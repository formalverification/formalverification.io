SOLUTION TO 1.
    \begin{solution}~\\[2pt]
      {\it Lemma:}\footnote{This is Exercise III.6.1 of Hungerford~\citeHungerford, page 165.}
      If $D$ is an integral domain containing an irreducible element $c\in D$, then
      $D[x]$ is not a PID. 
      \\[4pt]
      {\it Proof:} Let $c$ be an irreducible element in $D$ (i.e.~$c$ is a nonzero
      nonunit and $c = ab$ only if $a$ or $b$ is a unit). Suppose 
      $D[x]$ is a PID, and consider the ideal $(c,x)$ of $D[x]$.
      % -- that is, the ideal generated by $c$ and $x$. 
      Then $(d) = (c,x)$ for some $d\in D[x]$.
      This implies $c\in (d)$, so $c = g d$, for some $g \in D[x]$.  By
      irreducibility of $c$, either $g$ is a unit or $d$ is a unit.  
      If $d$ is a unit, then $(d)$ would be all of $D[x]$.  But $(d) = (c,x) \neq
      D[x]$ (for one thing, $1\notin (c, x)$), so $d$ is not a unit.  
      Therefore, $g$ must be a unit, so we can write $d = g^{-1} c$.  
      This implies $d\in (c)$, so $(c,x) = (d) = (c)$.  It follows that $x \in (c)$, 
      and thus $x = fc$ for some $f \in D[x]$.  Finally, $x$ is
      irreducible,\footnote{To see that $x$ is irreducible in $D[x]$, argue by degree.}
      so $f$ must be a unit, but this
      puts both $f$ and $c$, hence $x$, in $D$, which is impossible.
      \qed
      
      \begin{corollary}\label{cor:1}
        If $\F$ is a field and $n\geq 2$, then $\F[x_1, \dots, x_n]$
        is not a PID.
      \end{corollary}
      This follows from the lemma above since $x_1$ is irreducible in
      $\F[x_1,\dots, x_n]$. (If $x_1 = ab$ for some $a, b\in
      \F[x_1,\dots, x_n]$, then, arguing by degree, either $a\in \F$ or
      $b\in \F$.)
      % note that $x_1$ is a nonzero nonunit and (by Theorem 6.1
      % of~\cite{Hungerford:1974}), 
      % \[
      % x_1 = ab 
      % \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
      % 1 = \mbox{deg}_1 (x_1) = \mbox{deg}_1 (a) + \mbox{deg}_1(b) 
      % \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
      % \mbox{deg}_1 (a) = 0 \; \text{ or } \; \mbox{deg}_1 (b) = 0,
      % \]
      % where $\mbox{deg}_i(f)$ denotes the highest power of $x_i$ appearing in the
      % polynomial $f(x)\in \F[x_1, \dots, x_n]$.  Also, $\mbox{deg}_i(x_1) = 0$ implies 
      % $\mbox{deg}_i(a) = \mbox{deg}_i(b) = 0$.  Thus, either $a \in \F$ or $b \in \F$,
      % so one of them is a unit, which proves that $x_1$ is irreducible.

      \begin{theorem} \label{thm:polyringUFD}
        If $D$ is a UFD, then so is the polynomial ring $D[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. 
      \end{theorem}
      By corollary~\ref{cor:1} above, however, $D[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ need not be a PID when $n\geq 2$. 
      (Note that a field is trivially a UFD.)   
      % In this
      % special case, we note that $(x,y)$ is a maximal ideal in $\F_2[x,y]$ which is
      % not principal.  (Both properties of $(x,y)$ are easy to verify.)
      \begin{enumerate}[{\bf a.}]
      \item $\F_2[x,y]$\\
        Since $\F_2$ is a field, it is a UFD, so theorem~\ref{thm:polyringUFD} implies
        that $\F_2[x,y]$ is a UFD.  However, as in the corollary above, $\F_2[x,y]$ is
        not a PID.  
        In particular, $(x,y)$ is a (maximal) ideal in $\F_2[x,y]$
        which is not principal, as the reader may easily verify.
      \item $\F_2[x,y]/(y^2 + y + 1)$\\
        Letting $D = \F_2[x]$, we have
        $\F_2[x,y]/(y^2 + y + 1) =  D[y]/(y^2 + y + 1)$.  It is easily verified that
        $D$ is a Euclidean domain with norm $\phi(f) = \deg(f)$.  Now, if the polynomial
        $g(y) = y^2+y+1$ is irreducible in $D[y]$, then $(g(y))$ is a maximal
        ideal and so $D[y]/(g(y))$ is a field.  To show that $g(y)$ is, indeed,
        irreducible, suppose $g(y) = ab$, for some $a, b \in D[y]$.  Then $\deg_x(a) =
        \deg_x(b) = 0$ so $a, b \in \F_2[y]$.  If they are to be nonunits, $a$ and $b$
        must have $\deg_y(a) = \deg_y(b) = 1$.  The only choices are $a = y-\alpha$ and $b =
        y-\beta$ for some $\alpha, \beta \in \F_2$.  That is, $g(y) = y^2 + y + 1$ must
        have roots in $\F_2$, which it does not ($g(0) = 1$ and $g(1) = 3 \equiv 1$).
        Therefore, $g(y)$ is irreducible in $D[y] = \F_2[x,y]$.  We have thus shown
        that $E = \F_2[x,y]/(y^2 + y + 1)$ is a field.
        % , hence a Euclidean domain (with $\phi(a) = 1$ for all $a\in E$).
      \item $\R[x,y]/(x^2+y^2)$\\
        First note that $(x^2+y^2)$ is not a maximal ideal of $\R[x,y]$.  For,
        $(x^2+y^2)\subsetneq (x,y) \subsetneq \R[x,y]$.  
        Letting $D = \R[x]$, and $p(y) = x^2+y^2$, we have
        $\R[x,y]/(x^2 + y^2) =  D[y]/(p(y))$.  The roots of $p(y)$ are $\pm
        \sqrt{-1} x$ which do not belong to $D$.  Thus $p(y)$ is irreducible
        in $D[y]$.  What else can we say about  $\R[x,y]/(x^2 + y^2) =  D[y]/(p(y))$?
        \\[4pt]
        \textcolor{red}{Finish this one!}
        \\[4cm]
      \item $\C[x,y]/(x^2+y^2)$\\
        Let $D = \C[x]$ and consider $\C[x,y]/(x^2 + y^2) =  D[y]/(p(y))$, 
        where $p(y) = x^2+y^2$.
        The roots of $p(y)$ in $D[y] = \C[x,y]$ are 
        $\pm i x$, and so $p(y)$ factors in $\C[x,y]$ as 
        $x^2+y^2 = (y+ix)(y-ix)$.  Therefore, $\C[x,y]/(x^2 + y^2)$ has zero divisors:
        let $a = y+ix + (x^2+y^2)$ and $b = y-ix + (x^2+y^2)$.  Then 
        $ab = (x^2 + y^2) = \bar{0}\in \C[x,y]/(x^2 + y^2)$.  Therefore, 
        $\C[x,y]/(x^2 + y^2)$ is not a domain.
      \item $\Z[\sqrt{-5}]$\\
        This is a domain (as a subring of $\C$) which is not a UFD. For example, $9$
        has a non-unique factorization as a product of irreducibles:
        \[
        9 =  3\cdot 3 = (2+\sqrt{5})\cdot (2-\sqrt{5}).
        \]
      \end{enumerate}
      Some useful references for problem 1 are Hungerford~\cite{Hungerford:1974}
      (in particular, p.~139 and cor.~6.4, p.~159), and Jacobson~\cite{Jacobson:1985} (p.~141).

SOLUTION TO 3.

Let $\sJ$ be the set of all proper ideals in $R$ and consider the
partially ordered set $(\sJ, \subseteq)$. Let
$\{A_\alpha : \alpha \in \sA\}$ be any chain in $\sJ$ – i.e.  $\sA$ is a
totally ordered index set and for all $\alpha, \beta \in \sA$, if
$\alpha
        \leq \beta$, then $A_\alpha \subseteq A_\beta$. Define $J =
        \bigcup\limits_{\alpha\in \sA} A_\alpha$. We verify that $J$ is
a proper ideal of $R$. Of course, as a union of subgroups of the abelian
group reduct $\langle
        R; +, -, 0\rangle$, $J$ is a subgroup. Fix $r \in R$ and
$j \in J$. Then there exists $A_\alpha \in \sJ$ such that
$j \in A_\alpha$, so $rj \in A_\alpha
        \subseteq J$. Therefore, $J$ is an ideal. It is a proper ideal
because otherwise $1_R\in J$, which would imply that $1_R \in A_\alpha$
for some $\alpha \in \sA$. But then $A_\alpha = R$ which contradicts the
definition of $\sJ$.

Thus, we have $J\in \sJ$, and $J$ is an upper bound for
$\{A_\alpha: \alpha \in
        \sA\}$. By Zorn’s lemma, $\sJ$ has a maximal element.

For an example of a commutative ring with only one maximal ideal, take
the set $\Z_4 = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ and define $+$ and $\cdot$ on $\Z_4$ to
be addition mod 4 and multiplication mod 4, respectively. Then the ideal
generated by 2 is $(2) = \{0, 2\}$, and this is the only maximal ideal.
For $1$ and $3$ are units, so $(1) = (3) = \Z_4$. (You should generalize
this argument and convince yourself that, if $p$ is prime and $n\geq 1$,
then $\Z_{p^n}$ is a ring with unique maximal ideal $(p)$.)

A ring is called a *local* ring iff it has a unique maximal ideal. Let
$R$ be a commutative ring with $1_R$. We must show that $R$ is local iff
the set of nonunits forms an ideal. To do so, we prove the equivalence
of the following three statements:

1.  \[it:1\] $R$ is a local ring.

2.  \[it:2\] All nonunits of $R$ are contained in some ideal $M\neq R$.

3.  \[it:3\] The set of all nonunits of $R$ forms an ideal.

Throughout, we let $S$ denote the set of all nonunits in $R$. We will
prove (\[it:2\]) $\Rightarrow$ (\[it:3\]) $\Rightarrow$ (\[it:1\])
$\Rightarrow$ (\[it:2\]).

Suppose (\[it:2\]) holds so that $S\subseteq M$ where $M$ is a proper
ideal of $R$. Of course, an ideal is a proper ideal iff it contains only
nonunits. Therefore, $S\subseteq M\subseteq S$, so $S = M$, which proves
(\[it:3\]).

Suppose (\[it:3\]) holds, and let $S \subseteq J \subseteq R$ be a chain
of ideals. Then, as above, $J=R$ unless $J\subseteq S$, so $S$ contains
all proper ideals of $R$. By (\[it:3\]), $S$ itself is and ideal, so it
is the unique maximal ideal, which proves (\[it:1\]).

If (\[it:1\]), then there is a unique maximal ideal $M\subsetneq R$. Fix
$a\in
        S$. Now, there is always a maximal ideal of $R$ which contains
the ideal $(a)$ (by Zorn’s lemma). But $M$ is the *unique* maximal ideal
of $R$. Therefore, $(a) \subseteq M$. Since $a\in S$ was arbitrary, this
proves that $S \subseteq M$ and (\[it:2\]) holds.
