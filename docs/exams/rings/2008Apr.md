SOLUTION 1

A commutative ring $R$ is *Noetherian* provided $R$ satisfies the
*ascending chain condition* (ACC) on ideals. That is, for any chain
$I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq \cdots $ of ideals of $R$, there is an
$N\in \N$ such that $I_{n} = I_{n+1}$ for all $n\geq
        N$. (By Zorn’s lemma, a condition which is equivalent to the ACC
is that every nonempty set of ideals contains a maximal element.) More
generally, an $R$-module is Noetherian provided it satisfies the ACC on
submodules. This is the Hilbert Basis Theorem, which can be found in
many standard references, for example, Theorem VIII.4.9 of Hungerford
[@Hungerford:1974]. The proof in Hungerford uses a fundamental theorem
([@Hungerford:1974], VIII.1.9) which is worth noting: a module $M$ is
Noetherian if and only if every submodule of $M$ is finitely generated.
In particular, a commutative ring $R$ is Noetherian if and only if every
ideal of $R$ is finitely generated. Therefore, to show that $R[x]$ is
Noetherian, it suffices to show that every ideal $J$ in $R[x]$ is
finitely generated.

SOLUTION 2.
First, note that $R/J$ is a commutative ring with multiplication
$(a + J)(b + J) = ab + J$, for $a, b \in R$, additive identity
$\bar{0} = J$, and multiplicative identity $1_R + J$. (That the ring
axioms are satisfied is easily verified.)

($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $J$ is prime and
$(a + J)(b + J) = ab + J = \bar{0}= J$. Then $ab \in J$ so either
$a\in J$ and $a + J  = \bar{0}$ or $b\in J$ and $b + J  = \bar{0}$. That
is, $R/J$ has no zero divisors.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $R/J$ is an integral domain. Then, since an
integral domain has a (non-zero) multiplicative identity – in this case,
$1_R + J$ – it’s clear that $J \neq
        R$. Now, suppose $ab \in J$. Then
$(a + J)(b + J) = ab + J = \bar{0}$. It follows that either
$a + J=\bar{0}$ or $b + J=\bar{0}$, since $R/J$ is a domain. That is,
either $a\in J$ or $b\in J$, which proves that $J$ is prime.

($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $J$ is maximal and $a+J \neq \bar{0}$ in $R/J$.
Then $a\notin J$. Consider the ideal generated by $a$ and $J$, denoted
$(a,
        J)$. Since $J \subsetneq (a, J)\subseteq R$ and $J$ is maximal,
it must be the case that $(a, J)=R$. Whence, $1_R \in (a, J)$, so
$1_R = ab + rj$ for some $j \in J$, $r, b\in R$. Therefore,
$1_R - ab \in J$ so $(a + J)(b + J)  = ab+J = 1_R+J$, which shows that
$a+J$ is a unit in $R/J$. Since $a+J$ was an arbitrary non-zero element,
this proves that $R/J$ is a field.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $R/J$ is a field. Let $J\subseteq I \subseteq R$
be a chain of ideals. Suppose there exists an element
$a\in I\setminus J$. Then $a+J$ is non-zero, so there is a $b+J\in R/J$
such that $ab + J = 1_R + J$. Now, since $a\in I$, an ideal, clearly
$ab \in I$ as well. Also, $ab-1_R \in J \subseteq I$. Therefore,
$1_R\in I$, which implies $I = R$. This proves that $J$ is maximal.

Let $\sI$ be the set of all proper ideals of $R$ which contain $J$. Then
$\langle \sI, \subseteq\rangle$ is a partially ordered set. Let
$\{J_\lambda : \lambda \in \Lambda\}$ be a chain of subsets of $\sI$
indexed by $\Lambda$ (totally ordered by set inclusion).[^1] Define
$M = \bigcup \{J_\alpha : \alpha \in \Lambda\} $. We verify that (1) $M$
is an ideal and (2) $M$ belongs to $\sI$: First, $a, b \in M$ implies
$a\in J_\alpha$ and $b\in J_\beta$ for some $\alpha, \beta \in \Lambda$.
Without loss of generality, suppose $J_\alpha\subseteq J_\beta$. Then
both $a$ and $b$ are in $J_\beta$, so $a-b\in J_\beta \subseteq M$,
which proves that $M$ is a subgroup of $\langle R, +, 0_R \rangle$. If
$r\in R$, then $ra\in J_\alpha \subseteq M$, so (1) is proved. To see
that $M$ is proper, note that $1_R$ cannot belong to
$M = \bigcup_\alpha J_\alpha$. For, if $1_R \in M$, then $1_R \in
        J_\gamma$ for some $\gamma \in \Lambda$. But each $J_\gamma$ is
a proper ideal, so this can’t happen. (Any ideal which contains a unit
is all of $R$.) We have thus shown that every chain in the poset
$\langle \sI, \subseteq\rangle$ has an upper bound in the set $\sI$.
Therefore, by Zorn’s lemma,[^2] $\sI$ has a maximal element. That is,
$J$ is contained in a maximal ideal.

($\Rightarrow$) Let $a \in R$ be nilpotent and let $P\subset R$ be a
prime ideal. Then $P$ is, in particular, a subgroup of
$\langle R, +, 0_R \rangle$, so $0_R \in P$. Let $n\in \N$ be such that
$a^n = 0_R$. Then $a^n \in P$ and, recall the following fact
(Corollary \[cor:2.15\]) for prime ideals in a *commutative* ring: for
$b_1, b_2, \cdots, b_k \in R$,
$$\text{if $b_1 b_2 \cdots b_k \in P$ then $b_i \in P$ for some $i\in \{1,\dots,k\}$.}$$
Applied in the present case, $a^n \in P$ implies $a\in P$.
($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $a$ is not nilpotent; i.e. for all $n\in \N$,
$a^n \neq 0$. Consider the set $A = \{a^n: n\in \N\}$. This is a
multiplicative set which is disjoint from the zero ideal $(0)$. By
Theorem \[thm:primemult\], then, there is a prime ideal $P$ which is
disjoint from $A$, whence $a\notin P$.

SOLUTION 3.
(Hungerford [@Hungerford:1974] section IV.5, pp. 207–209, gives the
clearest, most succinct exposition of the tensor product and its basic
properties.) Let $F$ be the free abelian group on the set $A\times B$
and let $K$ be the subgroup of $F$ generated by all elements of the form

1.  $(a_1 + a_2, b) - (a_1, b)- (a_2, b)$

2.  $(a, b_1 + b_2) - (a, b_1)- (a, b_2)$

3.  $(ar, b) - (a,rb)$

where $a, a_1, a_2\in A$, $b, b_1, b_2 \in B$, and $r\in R$. The
quotient group $F/K$ is an abelian group called the *tensor product* of
$A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \otimes_R B$. That is, we define
$A \otimes_R B = F/K$.

Define the map $\varphi: \Z_m \times \Z_n \rightarrow \Z_d$ by
$\varphi(x,y) = xy \pmod d$, for $x\in \Z_m$, $y\in \Z_n$. Then it is
easy to check that $\varphi$ is a *middle linear* map. That is,
$\varphi$ satisfies, for all $x, x_1, x_2 \in \Z_m$,
$y, y_1, y_2 \in \Z_n$, and $r\in \Z$,
$$\varphi(x_1+x_2, y) = \varphi(x_1, y) + \varphi(x_2,y),$$
$$\varphi(x, y_1+y_2) = \varphi(x, y_1) + \varphi(x,y_2),$$
$$\varphi(xr,y) = \varphi(x,ry).$$ Therefore, by the universal property,
there is a unique (abelian group) homomorphism
$\bar{\varphi} :  \Z_m \otimes \Z_n \rightarrow \Z_d$ such that
$\bar{\varphi} \iota = \varphi$ where $\iota$ is the canonical middle
linear map, $(a,b)\mapsto a\otimes b$. In other words, we have the
following commutative diagram:
$$\xymatrix{\Z_m \times \Z_n \ar@{->}[dr]_{\varphi} \ar[rr]^{\iota}& & \Z_m \otimes \Z_n \ar@{->}[dl]^{\bar{\varphi}} \\ & \Z_d & }$$
The proof is complete if $\bar{\varphi}$ is actually an isomorphism.
Equivalently, there should exist a
$\psi\in \Hom_R(\Z_d, \Z_m\otimes \Z_n)$ such that
$\bar{\varphi} \psi = 1_{\Z_d}$ and
$\psi \bar{\varphi} = 1_{\Z_m\otimes\Z_n}$. Indeed, define $\psi$ on
$\Z_d$ to be the mapping $x\mapsto x\otimes 1$. Then $\psi$ is a group
homomorphism. (Proof:
$\psi(x+y)=(x+y)\otimes 1 = x\otimes 1 + y\otimes 1 = \psi(x) + \psi(y)$
for all $x, y\in \Z_d$.) Also, for all $x\in \Z_d$,
$$\bar{\varphi}\psi(x) = \bphi(x\otimes 1) = \bphi \iota (x,1) = \vphi(x,1) = x1 \bmod d  = x.$$
That is, $\bar{\varphi} \psi = 1_{\Z_d}$. Next consider the action of
$\psi\bphi$ on generators of $\Z_m\otimes\Z_n$: for
$x\in \Z_m,\; y\in \Z_n$, $$\label{eq:100}
        \psi\bar{\varphi}(x\otimes y) = \psi\vphi(x,y) = \psi(xy\bmod d) = xy\bmod d \otimes 1 = x\bmod d \otimes y\bmod d = x\otimes y.$$
Since $\psi\bar{\varphi}$ is a homomorphism, the identity (\[eq:100\])
extends to finite sums of generators:
$$\psi\bar{\varphi}(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\otimes y_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\otimes y_i.$$
Whence, $\psi\bar{\varphi} = 1_{\Z_m\otimes\Z_n}$, as desired.

[^1]: This simply means that, for any $\alpha, \beta \in
              \Lambda$, either $J_\alpha \subseteq J_\beta$ or
    $J_\beta\subseteq
              J_\alpha$. Consequently, we can totally order the index
    set $\Lambda$ by declaring $\alpha\leq \beta$ if and only if
    $J_\alpha \subseteq J_\beta$.

[^2]: In proofs involving Zorn’s lemma, it is often better to use a
    symbol that signifies an arbitrary index set, like $\Lambda$ (as
    opposed to, say, $\N$), as we typically want the argument to work
    for uncountable collections of sets. This may seem like a minor
    point, but examiners are likely to notice this sort of thing.
