   b. Assuming your module actions from the first part, prove that $M$ is in fact an $(S,T)$ or $(T,S)$ bimodule (whichever is appropriate).

4. Give an example of each of the following or prove that none exists (no proof required).\
   a. An injective $\mathbb Z[i, \pi]$-module. (You may assume that $\pi$ is transcendental over $\mathbb Q$.)\

SOLUTION 1.

If $A$ is a finitely generated module over a PID $R$, then

(i) $A$ is a direct sum of a free submodule $F$ of finite rank and
    finitely many cyclic torsion modules. The cyclic torsion summands
    (if any) are of orders $r_1, \dots, r_t$ where the $r_1, \dots, r_t$
    are (not necessarily distinct) nonzero nonunits in $R$ satisfying
    $r_1 | r_2 | \cdots | r_t$. The rank of $F$ and the ideals
    $(r_1), \dots, (r_t)$ are uniquely determined by $A$.

(ii) $A$ is a direct sum of a free submodule $E$ of finite rank and a
    finite number of cyclic torsion modules. The cyclic torsion summands
    (if any) are of orders $p_1^{s_1}, \dots, p_k^{s_k}$ where the
    $p_1, \dots, p_k$ are (not necessarily distinct) primes in $R$ and
    the $s_1, \dots, s_k$ are positive integer. The rank of $E$ and the
    ideals $(p_1^{s_1}), \dots, (p_k^{s_k})$ are uniquely determined by
    $A$ (except for the order in which the $p_i$ appear).

Symbolically, the situation in part (i) of this theorem is as follows:
$$A \cong F \oplus R a_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus R a_t \cong F \oplus R/ (r_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus R/(r_t),$$
where $(r_i) = \ann(a_i) = \{r\in R : r a_i = 0\}$. Note that
$r_1|r_2|\cdots
      | r_t$ holds if and only if
$\ann(a_t) \subseteq \cdots \subseteq \ann(a_1)$, in which case
$r_t a = 0$ for all $a\in \Tor(A)$. The situation in part (ii) of the
theorem can be written symbolically as
$$A \cong  E \oplus R/ (p_1^{s_1}) \oplus \cdots \oplus R/(p_k^{s_k}).$$


PROBLEM 3.
An action of $S$ on $M$ making $M$ into a left $S$-module is given as
follows: for all $s\in S$, $f\mapsto sf$, where $(sf)(a) = f(as)$, for
all $a\in A$. An action of $T$ on $M$ making $M$ into a right $T$-module
is given as follows: for all $t\in T$, $f\mapsto ft$ where
$(ft)(a) = f(a)t$, for all $a\in A$.

That $M$ is an $(S,T)$-bimodule can be seen by simply checking that it
satisfies the definition; by checking that $M$ is both a left $S$-module
and a right $T$-module. Indeed, for all
$a\in A, \; s_1, s_2, s \in S, \; f_1, f_2, f\in M$, we have
$$\begin{aligned}
          ((s_1+s_2)f)(a) &= f(a(s_1+s_2)) = f(a s_1+ a s_2) \quad \text{(since $A$ is a right $S$-module)}\\
          &= f(a s_1)+ f(a s_2) = (s_1 f)(a)+(s_2 f)(a) = (s_1f+ s_2f)(a),
        \end{aligned}$$
$$(s(f_1+f_2))(a) = (f_1+f_2)(as) = f_1(as) + f_2(as)=sf_1(a) + sf_2(a)=(sf_1+ sf_2)(a),$$
and
$(s_1(s_2f))(a)= (s_2f)(a s_1) = f((a s_1) s_2) =  f(a (s_1 s_2)) = ((s_1s_2)f)(a)$.
The penultimate equality holds, again, because $A$ is a right
$S$-module. This proves that $M$ is a left $S$-module. The proof that
$M$ is a right $T$-module is similar, so we leave it to the reader to
check that, since $B$ is a right $T$-module, the following holds: For
all $a\in A, \; t_1, t_2, t \in T, \; f_1, f_2, f\in M$,
$$(f(t_1+t_2))(a) = (f t_1+ f t_2)(a),$$
$$((f_1+f_2)t)(a) =(f_1t)(a) + (f_2t)(a),$$
$$(f(t_1 t_2))(a) =  ((f t_1)t_2)(a).$$ It follows that $M$ is an
$(S,T)$-bimodule.
