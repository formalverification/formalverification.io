1. Let $R$ be a ring, $I$ a right ideal and $J$ a left ideal of $R$. The expression $I+J$ stands for the Abelian group generated by $I\cup J$. Prove that $$\frac{R}{I}\otimes_R \frac{R}{J} \cong \frac{R}{I+J}.$$ Define your maps carefully with particular attention to well-definedness.

2. Let $A_1$ and $A_2$ be modules over some ring, $K_1\subseteq A_1$ and $K_2\subseteq A_2$ be submodules, and $\gamma_1: A_1\rightarrow A_2$ and $\gamma_2: A_2\rightarrow A_1$ and be homomorphisms with the following properties.\
   i. $\gamma_1(K_1) \subseteq K_2$ and $\gamma_2(K_2) \subseteq K_1$,\
   ii. $(1-\gamma_2\gamma_1)(A_1) \subseteq K_1$ and $(1-\gamma_1\gamma_2)(A_2) \subseteq K_2$.\
   a. Show that the maps $f \colon A_1\oplus K_2 \rightarrow A_2\oplus K_1$ and $g \colon A_2\oplus K_1 \rightarrow A_1\oplus K_2$ defined by
   \begin{align*} 
   f(x_1,y_2) &= (\gamma_1(x_1) - y_2, -x_1 + \gamma_2\gamma_1(x_1) - \gamma_2(y_2)),  \text{ and }\\\\ 
   g(x_2,y_1) &= (\gamma_2(x_2) - y_1, -x_2 + \gamma_1\gamma_2(x_2) - \gamma_1(y_1))
   \end{align*}
   are well-defined homomorphisms and that $g = f^{-1}$.\
   b. Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be projective modules and $M$ a module over some ring $R$. Suppose that $\beta_1: P_1\rightarrow M$ and $\beta_2: P_2 \rightarrow M$ are epimorphisms. Show that $P_1\oplus \ker(\beta_2) \cong P_2\oplus \ker(\beta_1)$.

3. Let $M_n(R)$ be the ring of matrices with coefficients in a ring $R$ (with 1), where $n$ is a natural number $> 1$. For a (two-sided) ideal $I$ of $R$, let $M_n(I) = \\{[a_{ij}]\in M_n(R) : a_{ij}\in I\\}$.\
   a. Prove that $M_n(I)$ is an ideal of $M_n(R)$.\
   b. Prove that every ideal of $M_n(R)$ is of the form $M_n(I)$ for a suitable ideal $I$ of $R$.

4. Recall that a module is *simple* if it is nontrivial and has no proper submodules.\
   a. Prove that the endomorphism ring of a simple module is a division ring (= skew field).\
   b. Prove that a ring $R$ with identity 1 contains a left ideal $I$ such that $R/I$ is a simple left $R$-module.\
   c. Let $R$ be a ring with identity 1 and suppose that $M = _RM$ is a left $R$-module with the property that every submodule is a direct summand (“everybody splits”). Show that every non-zero submodule $K$ of $M$ contains a simple submodule.

SOLUTION 1.
\[lemma:tensorelement\] Every element of
$\frac{R}{I}\otimes_R \frac{R}{J}$ can be written as a simple tensor
$(1+I)\otimes (r+J)$, for some $r\in R$.

Note that every element can certainly be written as a finite sum of
generators, say,
$(s_1+I)\otimes (r_1+J) + \cdots + (s_n+I)\otimes (r_n+J)$. Also,
$(s_i+I)\otimes (r_i+J) = (1+I)\otimes (s_ir_i+J)$, so
$$\sum_{i=1}^n (s_i+I)\otimes (r_i+J) =  \sum_{i=1}^n (1+I)\otimes (s_ir_i+J) =  (1+I)\otimes \left((\sum s_ir_i)+J\right).$$
This proves the lemma.

Now define the map
$\theta: \frac{R}{I}\times \frac{R}{J} \rightarrow \frac{R}{I+J}$ by
$\theta(s+I, r+J) = sr + (I+J)$. This is clearly a well-defined mapping
from one abelian group to another. For, if $(s+I, r+J) = (s'+I, r'+J)$,
then $s-s' \in I$ and $r-r'\in J$, so
$$sr -s'r' = sr - sr' + sr' - s'r' = s(r-r') + (s-s')r' \in I+J.$$
Therefore, $(s+I, r+J) = (s'+I, r'+J)$ implies
$\theta(s+I, r+J) = \theta(s'+I, r'+J)$.

A routine calculation shows that the mapping $\theta$ is bilinear, and
therefore (by the universal property of tensor products) induces a
unique homomorphism
$\hat{\theta}:\frac{R}{I}\otimes_R \frac{R}{J} \rightarrow \frac{R}{I+J},$
which is clearly surjective. To show that $\hat{\theta}$ is also
injective, suppose $x\in \ker \hat{\theta}$. By
lemma \[lemma:tensorelement\], $x = (1+I)\otimes (r+J)$ for some
$r\in R$, and
$$0=\hat{\theta}(x) = r+(I+J)\quad \Rightarrow  \quad r\in I+J\quad \Rightarrow \quad r = i+j,$$
for some $i\in I$ and $j\in J$. Therefore,
$$x = (1+I)\otimes (i+j+J) = (1+I)\otimes (i+J) = (i+I)\otimes (1+J) = I\otimes(1+J) = 0.$$
This shows that $ \ker \hat{\theta} = 0$, so $\hat{\theta}$ is an
isomorphism.

SOLUTION 3.
The first part is very easy. The second part is proved for $n=2$ below (see proposition \[prop:1\]), and for the general case in Lam’s book .


SOLUTION 4.
Let $M$ be a simple $R$-module, and suppose $\varphi$ is an endomorphism
of $M$ that is not identically zero. We must show that $\varphi$ is
invertible. It suffices to show that $\varphi$ is bijective. $M$ is
simple, so $\{0\}$ and $M$ are the only submodules. Of course,
$\ker \varphi$ and $\im \varphi$ are both submodules of $M$ (as is
easily verified). Since $\varphi$ is not the zero map, it must be the
case that $\im \varphi\neq \{0\}$ and $\ker \varphi \neq M$. Thus,
$\varphi$ is bijective.

By the standard Zorn’s lemma argument, we can find a maximal left ideal
$I$ in $R$. It is easily verified that $R/I$ is a left $R$-module.
Suppose $M$ is a left $R$-submodule of $R/I$. Then, in particular, $M$
is a left ideal of $R/I$. Recall that the left ideals of $R/I$ are in
one-to-one correspondence with the left ideals of $R$ which contain $I$.
Moreover, each left ideal in $R/I$ has the form $J/I$ for some left
ideal $J$ in $R$ containing $I$ (see, e.g., Hungerford , p. 126). Thus,
we have a chain of left ideals $I \subseteq J \subseteq R$ with
$M = J/I$. Since $I$ is maximal, either $J = I$, in which case $M$ is
the zero submodule of $R/I$, or $J = R$, in which case $M = R/I$. Since
$M$ was an arbitrary submodule of $R/I$, this proves that $R/I$ is a
simple module.

Let $k$ be a nonzero element of $K$. Clearly $Rk\subseteq K$ is also a
submodule of $M$. Therefore, $M = Rk \oplus N$ for some submodule $N$ of
$M$.
