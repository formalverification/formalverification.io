SOLUTION 2.

   $\mathbf Z[\sqrt{-1}]$ can be embedded in $\C$ which is a UFD, so
$\Z[\sqrt{-1}]$ is a UFD. Consider
$(a + \sqrt{-3})(a - \sqrt{-3}) = a^2 + 3$. If we let $a=3$, then
$$(3+ \sqrt{-3})(3 - \sqrt{-3}) = 12 = 2^2 \cdot 3,$$ giving two
distinct factorizations of 12 in $\Z[\sqrt{-1}]$. Therefore,
$\Z[\sqrt{-1}]$ is not a UFD.

SOLUTION 3.
   Let $\varphi : R \rightarrow R$ be defined by $\varphi(r) = er$. Then $\varphi(r_1 r_2) = e r_1 r_2 = r_1 e r_2 = r_1 \varphi(r_2)$ and $\varphi(r_1 + r_2) = e (r_1 + r_2) = e r_1 + e r_2 = \varphi(r_1)+ \varphi(r_2)$. That is, $\varphi$ is an $R$-module endomorphism (viewing $R$ as a module over itself). Also, $\varphi$ is itself an idempotent element in the ring of endomorphisms $\End_RR$. That is, $\varphi \circ \varphi = \varphi$, as is easily verified.

Let $T = \im \varphi = \{\varphi(r) : r\in R\}$ and let
$S = \ker \varphi =  \{r\in R : \varphi(r) = 0\}$. Then, for any
$r \in R$ we have $$r = r - \varphi(r) + \varphi(r)$$ with
$\varphi(r) \in T$ and, since $\varphi$ is idempotent,
$r - \varphi(r) \in S$. Thus $R = S + T$. Now suppose $r \in S \cap T$.
Then $r \in T$ implies $r =
      \varphi(r')$ for some $r'\in R$. On the other hand, $r\in S$
implies $0 = \varphi(r)
      = \varphi(\varphi(r')) = \varphi(r') = r$, the penultimate
equality by idempotence of $\varphi$. This proves that $S \cap T  = 0$,
so $R = S \oplus T$.

We prove that $S$ and $T$ are ideals by simply checking the required
conditions. Fix $s_1, s_2 \in S$, and $r\in R$. First note that
$-s_1 \in S$ since $\varphi$ is an $R$-module homomorphism, so
$\varphi(-s_1) = \varphi(-1_R s_1)
      -1_R\varphi(s_1)$, where $1_R$ is the unit of $R$. It then follows
that $$\varphi(s_1 - s_2) = 
      \varphi(s_1) - \varphi(s_2) = 0 - 0 = 0$$ so $s_1 - s_2\in S$,
which proves that $S$ is a subgroup of the abelian group reduct
$\langle R, +, -, 0\rangle$ of $R$. Finally
$\varphi(rs_1) = r\varphi(s_1) = r\cdot
      0 = 0$, so $rs_1\in S$, which proves that $S$ is an ideal.

The proof that $T$ is an ideal is similar; we verify that $T$ is a
subgroup of the abelian group reduct $\langle R, +, -, 0\rangle$, and
then check that $rt \in T$ whenever $r\in R$ and $t\in T$.

SOLUTION 4.
This is the special case (in which $R$ is commutative) of problem 1 of April 2003.

SOLUTION 5. Fix $r_1, r_2 \in \ann(x)$ and $r\in R$. Then $(r_1 - r_2)x = r_1 x - r_2 x = 0$ so $r_1 - r_2\in \ann(x)$ so
$\ann(x)$ is a subgroup of the abelian group reduct
$\langle R, +, -, 0\rangle$. Also, $r r_1 x = r 0 = 0$ so
$r r_1 \in \ann(x)$ which proves that $\ann(x)$ is a left ideal of $R$.
Define $\varphi: R \rightarrow Rx$ by $\varphi(r) = rx$. Then $\varphi$
is clearly surjective. Also,
$\varphi(r_1 r_2) = r_1 r_2 x = r_1 \varphi(r_2)$, so $\varphi$ is an
$R$-module epimorphism. Finally,
$$\ker \varphi = \{r\in R : r x = 0\} = \ann(x).$$ Therefore, by the
first isomorphism theorem $R/\ann(x) \cong \im \varphi = Rx$.
