1. Let $R$ be a ring and $M$ a (left) $R$-module. Suppose that $M = K\oplus L$. In this problem, maps are written on the right, opposite the scalars that operate on the left.\
   a. Let $\phi \in \operatorname{Hom}_R(L, K)$. Show that $M = K \oplus L(1 + \phi)$ where $L(1+\phi) = \\{x + x\phi : x \in L\\}$\
   b. Suppose that $M = K \oplus L'$. show that there is $\phi \in \operatorname{Hom}_R(L, K)$ such that $L' = L(1 +\phi)$.\
   c. Prove that $L(1 + \phi) = L(1 + \psi)$ for $\phi, \psi \in \operatorname{Hom}_R(L, K)$ if and only if $\phi = \psi$.\
   d. Note that the previous parts establish a bijective correspondence between complementary summands of $K$ in $M = K \oplus L$ and $\operatorname{Hom}_R(L, K)$. Let $M$ be a $\mathbb Z$-module (i.e., an abelian group), and suppose $M = \langle a \rangle \oplus \langle b \rangle \oplus \langle c \rangle$, where $\langle a \rangle$ is cyclic of prime order $p$, $\langle b \rangle$ is cyclic of order $p^2$, and $\langle c \rangle$ is cyclic of order $p^3$. Count the different direct complements of $\langle b \rangle \oplus \langle c \rangle$ in $M$.

2. Let $p$ be a prime in $\mathbb Z$, and let $R = \{a/p^n : a, n \in \mathbb Z\}$.\
   a. Prove that $R$ is a PID, hence a unique factorization domain.\
   b. What are the primes and what are the units in $R$?\
   c. In case $p=3$, prove that $9$ is a greatest common divisor of $5$ and $7$.

3. Let $R$ be a ring and suppose that $I, J$ are (two-sided) ideals of $R$. Recall that $IJ = \left\\{\sum_i e_i f_i : e_i \in I, f_i \in J\right\\}$.\
   a. Prove that $IJ$ is an ideal of $R$ and $IJ \subseteq I \cap J$.\
   b. Assume now that $R$ is a PID, $I= Ra$, and $J = Rb$. Show that $IJ = RAB$ and that $IJ = I\cap J$ if and only if $ab$ is a least common multiple of $a$ and $b$.

4. Explain why $\left(\frac{\mathbb Z}{\mathbb 5Z}\right) [x] / (x^2 - 2)$ is a field.

<!-- 
Solution to 2.
Let I be an ideal of R. Then let d be gcd of all numerators of elements of I.
Claim: I = (d).
Let s \in I. Then s=a/p^n where a = dk for some k,n e Z. If we let r \in R, we have r d = kd/p^n = a/p^n = s, so I \subseteq (d).

(I DoNT KNoW IFIHAVE TO SHOW MORE FOR THIS, PARTICULARLY THE REVERSE INCLUSION)

A nonzero element in a PID is prime if and only if it is irreducible. We can see that there are no primes in Rif we let e R and let m \in Z, m \neq 0.
Every element of R with a power of p in the numerator is a unit:
Let $a/p^n \in R$. If $a =p^k$, then a/p^n = p^k/p^n = 1/p^{n-k} and 1/p^{n-k} 1/p^{n-k} = 1 (and clearly $1/p^{k-n} \in  R$).
Let a/p^n \in R with a not a power of p. Suppose a/p^n is a unit. Then there must exist b/p^k \in R such that a/p^n \cdot b/p^k = 1. This implies that $b = p^{n+k}/a$, which is only in $R$ if a is a power of $p$, a contradiction. So no such element is a unit.  Therefore, the only units are the elements of the set $\{1/p^k : k\in \mathbb Z\}$ (when any shared factors of the numerator and denominator are removed). Clearly this could also be expressed as $\{p^k : k\in \mathbb Z\}$.

A nonzero element in a PID is prime if and only if it is irreducible, i.e., if whenever r= ab with a, b \in R, at least one of a or b is a unit. If a is a composite in Z, i.e.,
a = bc, for some b,c \in Z, then a/p^n = b\cdot c/p^n \in R, and we have that $a/p^n$ is reducible (not prime).
If a is a prime in Z, then a/p^n = a/p^m \cdot 1/p^{n-m} for some integer m and 1/p^{n-m} is a unit in R. So we have that a/p^n is ireducible (prime).
5 = 9\cdot 5/9 and 7 = 9\cdot 7/9 so 9 is a divisor of both 5 and 7. Now let r = a/p^n (where any common factors are divided out, i.e. p does not divide a) be any other divisor of both 5 and 7. Then r must have a = 1 and $9 = p^{n+2}\cdot 1/p^n$, i.e. $r$ divides $9$. So we have that 9 is a gcd of 5 and 7.

Solution to 4.
This quotient is of a polynomial ring over the field ^over the ideal generated by a2 - 5Z
This polynomial is irreducible over the field (just input the five possibilities) so we have
an irre polynomial in the PID ()i Tus (a?- 2) is a maximal ideal and
the quotient is a field.
