## Acknowledgements

Bill Lampe, Ralph Freese, and JB Nation taught me how to solve problems in groups and rings (among other things). Nonetheless, I take responsibility for most of the mistakes and typos in the problems and solutions posted here.  For the others, I blame readers who fail to report them to me.  

Joking aside, in exchange for offering you these study materials for free, please do me the favor of emailing any **mistakes or typos to [williamdemeo at gmail](mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com)**.

<!-- 
Solutions will appear in a separate document. 

In solving many of the problems, the wisdom and guidance of Professor William Lampe was invaluable. A number of other professors provided additional expert advice and assistance.In particular, special thanks are due to Professor Ron Brown for leading a ring theory seminar in the fall of 2009, and Professor Tom Craven for taking over this job in the spring of 2010.

Some typographical and mathematical errors surely exist. Nonetheless, we hope this document is of some value to those wishing to gain a better understanding of groups and rings and develop important problem solving skills.

It's no secret that mathematics is best learned by solving problems, and the purpose of this document is to give the reader many problems to work on.
The solutions are there to assist you in filling any gaps, and to provide cautionary notes about typical oversights and points of confusion.
