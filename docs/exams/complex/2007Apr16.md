**Notation.** $\mathbb C$ is the set of complex numbers, $D = \\{z\in \mathbb C: |z|<1\\}$, and if $G\subset \mathbb C$ is an open set, then $H(G)$ is the set of holomorphic functions on $G$.

1. Give the Laurent series expansion of $\frac{1}{z(z-1)}$ in the region $A \equiv \\{z\in \mathbb C: 2< |z+2| < 3\\}$. <!-- \index{Laurent expansion} -->

2. Suppose for all $n\in \mathbb N$ that the function $f_n$ is holomorphic in $D$ and satisfies $|f_n(z)|<1$ for all $z \in D$. Also suppose that $\lim_{n\to \infty} \mathrm{Im}\ f_n(x) = 0$ for all $x\in (-1,0)$.\
   (a) Prove: $\lim_{n\to \infty} \mathrm{Im}\ f_n(1/2) = 0$.\
   (b) Give a complete statement of the convergence theorem that you use in part (a).

3. Use the residue theorem to evaluate $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1+x^4}\ dx$. <!-- \index{residue theorem!applied} -->

4. Present a function $f$ that has all of the following properties:\
   (i) $f$ is one-to-one and holomorphic on $D$.\
   (ii) $\\{f(z): z\in D\\} = \\{w \in \mathbb C: \mathrm{Re}\ w > 0, \ \mathrm{Im}\ w > 0\\}$.\
   (iii) $f(0) = 1+i$.  <!-- \index{conformal mapping!problems}   -->

5. (a) Prove: If $f: D \rightarrow D$ is holomorphic and $f(1/2) = 0$, then $|f(0)| \leq 1/2$.\
   (b) Give a complete statement of the maximum modulus theorem that you use in part (a). <!-- \index{maximum modulus theorem!applied} \index{Schwarz's lemma!applied} -->

6. Prove: If $G$ is a connected open subset of $\mathbb C$, any two points of $G$ can be connected by a parametric curve in $G$.

SOLUTION 1.

  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      \[
      f(z) = \frac{1}{z(z-1)} = \frac{1-z+z}{z(z-1)} = \frac{1}{z-1} - \frac{1}{z}.
      \]
      Let $u=z+2$.  Then $z = u-2$ and 
      $A = \\{u\in \mathbb C : 2 < |u| < 3\\}$.  Therefore,
      \[
      \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{u-2} = \frac{1}{u}\frac{1}{(1-2/u)} 
      = \frac{1}{u}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{2}{u}\right)^n
      \]
      converges for $|u|>2$ and, substituting $u=z+2$ in the last expression, we have
      \[
      \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{z+2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{2}{z+2}\right)^n
      = \sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^n(z+2)^{-n-1}
      = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n+1}(z+2)^n,
      \]
      converging for $2<|z+2|$.  Next, consider that
      \[
      \frac{1}{z-1} = \frac{1}{u-3} 
      = \frac{-1}{3(1-u/3)}
      = \frac{-1}{3}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{u}{3}\right)^n
      \]
      converges for $|u|<3$ and, substituting $u=z+2$ in the last expression, we have
      \[
      \frac{1}{z-1} = -\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{n+1}(z+2)^n,
      \]
      converging for $|z+2|<3$.  Therefore,
      \[
      f(z) = \frac{1}{z-1} - \frac{1}{z}
      = 
      -\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{n+1}(z+2)^n
      -\sum_{n=-\infty}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n+1}(z+2)^n,
      \]
      for $z\in A$.

SOLUTION 3.
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      Note that
      \[
      f(z) = \frac{1}{1+x^4} 
      =\frac{1}{(z^2 + i)(z^2 - i)}
      =\frac{1}{(z + e^{i\pi/4})(z - e^{i\pi/4})
        (z + e^{i3\pi/4})(z - e^{i3\pi/4})},
      \]
      which reveals that the poles of $f$ in the upper half plane are at
      $e^{i\pi/4}$ and $e^{i3\pi/4}$.  Let $\Gamma_R$ be the contour shown in the
      figure below; \ie $\Gamma_R = g(R) \union [-R,R]$, where $R>1$.
      Then, by the residue theorem, 
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:3-1}
        \int_{\Gamma_R} f(z) dz = 2\pi i \left[\Res(f,e^{i\pi/4}) + \Res(f,e^{i3\pi/4})\right].
      \end{equation}

      \begin{figure}[h!]
        \vspace{-5cm}
        \centering  
        \includegraphics[width=6cm]{residuecontour}
        % \caption{{\it The contour $\gamma_R$ referenced in the solution is
        %     labeled g in the figure.}}
        \label{fig:residuecontour}
      \end{figure}

      The other two poles of $f$ are in the lower half-plane, so both 
      $e^{i\pi/4}$ and $e^{i3\pi/4}$ are simple poles.  Therefore,
      \[
      \Res(f,e^{i\pi/4}) = \lim_{z\rightarrow e^{i\pi/4}} (z-e^{i\pi/4})f(z)
      = \frac{1}{2e^{i\pi/4}(e^{i\pi/4}-e^{i3\pi/4})(e^{i\pi/4}+e^{i3\pi/4})}
      = -\frac{1}{4} i e^{-i\pi/4},
      \]
      \[
      \Res(f,e^{i3\pi/4}) = \lim_{z\rightarrow e^{i3\pi/4}} (z-e^{i3\pi/4})f(z)
      = \frac{1}{2e^{i3\pi/4}(e^{i3\pi/4}-e^{i\pi/4})(e^{i3\pi/4}+e^{i\pi/4})}
      = \frac{1}{4} i e^{-i3\pi/4}.
      \]
      Plugging these into~(\ref{eq:3-1}) yields
      \[
      \int_{\Gamma_R} f(z) dz = 2\pi i \left(\frac{1}{4} i e^{-i3\pi/4} 
        -\frac{1}{4} i e^{-i\pi/4}\right) 
      = \frac{\pi}{2}(e^{-i\pi/4} - e^{-i3\pi/4}) = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}.
      \]

      It remains to show 
      \[
      \lim_{R\rightarrow \infty} \left| \int_{g(R)} f(z) dz \right| = 0.
      \]
      Changing variables via $z = Re^{i\theta} \; (0\leq \theta \leq \pi)$,
      \[
      \left| \int_{g(R)} f(z) dz \right| 
      = \left| \int_0^\pi \frac{i R e^{i\theta}}{1+(Re^{i\theta})^4}\right| 
      \leq \frac{\pi R}{R^4 - 1} \rightarrow 0, \quad \text{as $R \rightarrow \infty$}.
      \]

SOLUTION 4.

  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      First consider\footnote{This is my favorite M\"{o}ebius map. Not only
        does it map the unit disk onto the right half-plane, but also it maps the
        right half-plane onto the unit disk. This feature makes $\phi_1$
        an extremely useful tool for conformal mapping problems, where you're
        frequently required to map half-planes to the unit disk and
        vice-versa. Another nice feature of this map is that $\phi_1^{-1} =
        \phi_1$.  (Of course this must be the case if $\phi_1$ is to have the
        first feature.) Also note that, like all linear fractional transformations,
        $\phi_1$ is a holomorphic bijection of \mathbb C.  Therefore, if $\phi_1$ is to 
        map the interior of the unit disk to the right half-plane, it must
        also map the exterior of the unit disk to the left half-plane.}
      $\phi_1(z) = \frac{1-z}{1+z}$,
      which maps D onto the right half-plane 
      $\RHP = \\{z\in \mathbb C: \mathrm{Re} z > 0\\}$.  
      Let $\phi_2(z) = e^{i\pi/2}z = iz$,
      which maps $\RHP$ onto the upper half-plane 
      $\UHP = \\{z\in \mathbb C: \mathrm{Im} z > 0\\}$. Next, let $\phi_3(z) = z^{1/2}$ 
      be a branch of the square root function on \UHP.  Then
      $\phi_3$ maps \UHP\ onto the first quadrant 
      $Q_1 =  \\{z\in \mathbb C: 0 < \mbox{arg}(z) < \pi/2 \\}$.

      The function $\phi = \phi_3 \circ \phi_2 \circ \phi_1$
      satisfies the first two conditions, so we check whether it satisfies
      condition (iii):
      \[ \phi_1(0) = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (\phi_2\circ \phi_1)(0) = \phi_2(1) = i
      \quad \Rightarrow \quad (\phi_3 \circ \phi_2 \circ \phi_1)(0) =
      \phi_3(i) = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}} \] 
      so apparently we're off by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.  This is easy to
      fix: let $\phi_4(z) = \sqrt{2} z$.  Then the holomorphic function
      $f \triangleq \phi_4 \circ \phi$ maps D bijectively onto $Q_1$ and
      % $f(0) = (\phi_4 \circ \phi)(0) = 1+i$, as
      $f(0) = 1+i$, as desired. \qed

      % \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
      %   (\ref{item:2}) 
      (i) Define $\phi(z) = \frac{1/2 - z}{1-z/2}$.  This is a %linear fractional transformation and, in fact, a 
      holomorphic bijection\footnote{See Rudin~\cite{Rudin:1987} page 254-5 (in
        particular, theorem 12.4) for a nice discussion of functions of the form 
        $\phi_\alpha(z) =  \frac{z-\alpha}{1-\bar{\alpha}z}$. 
        In addition to 12.4, sec.~12.5 and theorem 12.6 are popular exam
        questions.} 
      of $\bar{D}$ onto $\bar{D}$.  Therefore, 
      $g = f \circ \phi \in H(D)$, $|g(z)|\leq 1$ for all $z\in D$, and
      $g(0) = f(\phi(0)) = f(1/2) = 0$.  Thus $g$ satisfies the hypotheses of
      Schwarz's lemma (theorem~\ref{thm:schwarz}), which allows us to conclude the following:\\
      % \begin{enumerate} \item \label{item:3} 
      \phantom{xx}      (a) $|g(z)| \leq |z|$, for all $z\in D$, and \\
      % \item \label{item:4} 
      \phantom{xx}      (b) $|g'(0)| \leq 1$,\\
      % \end{enumerate}
      with equality in (a) for some $z\in D$ or equality
      in (b) iff $g(z) = e^{i\theta}z$ for some constant
      $\theta \in \R$.  By condition (a), %\ref{item:3}, 
      \[1/2 \geq |g(1/2)| = |f(\phi(1/2))| = |f(0)|.\] 
      \qed

      % (\ref{item:5}) 
      (ii) In part 
      % (\ref{item:2}) 
      (i) I used Schwarz's lemma, a complete statement of which appears in the appendix
      (theorem~\ref{thm:schwarz}).  This is
      sometimes thought of as a version of the maximum modulus principle since it
      is such an easy corollary of what is usually called the maximum modulus
      principle.  Here is a complete statement of the latter:

      % \begin{theorem}[maximum modulus principle, ver.~1]
      {\bf (max modulus principle, version 1)}\\
      Suppose $G\subset \mathbb C$ is open and $f\in H(G)$ attains its maximum
      modulus at some point $a\in G$.  Then $f$ is constant.  
      % \end{theorem}

      That is, if there is a point $a \in G$ with $|f(z)|\leq |f(a)|$ for all $z\in G$,
      then $f$ is constant.\footnote{There are a couple of other versions of the maximum
        modulus principle you should know, though for most problems on the comprehensive 
        exams, the version above usually suffices.  The other two versions are
        stated and proved clearly and concisely in Conway~\cite{Conway:1978}, but they also
        appear as theorems~\ref{thm:max-mod-2} and~\ref{thm:max-mod-3} of the appendix.}

SOLUTION 6.
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      First, recall that if
      $A\subset G \subset \mathbb C$, then $A$ is said to be 
      {\it open relative to}
      $G$, or simply {\it open in} $G$, if for any $a\in A$ there is a neighborhood 
      $B(a,\epsilon) = \\{z\in \mathbb C: |z-a|<\epsilon\\}$ such that $B(a,\epsilon)
      \intersect G \subset A$.\footnote{For example, the set $A = [0,1]$, although
        closed in \mathbb C, is open in $G = [0,1]\union \\{2\\}$.}

      Next, recall that a subset $G\subset \mathbb C$ is {\it connected} iff the only
      subsets of $G$ that are both open and closed 
      relative to $G$ are the empty set and $G$ itself.  
      Equivalently, if there exist non-empty disjoint subsets 
      $A, B \subset G$ that are open in $G$ and have the property
      $G = A\cup B$, then $G$ is not connected, 
      \index{disconnected}
      or {\it disconnected}.\footnote{
        To see the equivalence note that, in this case, $A$ is open in $G$, as is
        $A^c = G\setminus A = B$, so $A$ is both open and closed in $G$. Also
        it is instructive to check, using either definition, that $G = [0,1]\union
        \\{2\\}$ is disconnected.}

      Now, suppose $G$ is a connected open subset of \mathbb C.  Fix $z_0\in G$ and let
      $\Omega \subset G$ be the subset of 
      points that can be connected to $z_0$ by a parametric curve in $G$.
      Since $G$ is open, $\exists B(z_0,\epsilon) \subset G$ for some $\epsilon >
      0$, and clearly $B(z_0,\epsilon) \subset \Omega$.  In particular, 
      $\Omega \mathbb Neq \emptyset$ .  If we can 
      show $\Omega$ is both open and closed in $G$, then it will follow by
      connectedness that $\Omega = G$, and the problem will be solved. 

      ($\Omega$ is open) Let $w\in \Omega$ be connected to $z_0$ by a parametric curve 
      $\gamma \subset G$.  Since $G$ is open, $\exists \epsilon > 0$ such that
      $B(w,\epsilon)\subset G$.  Clearly any $w_1 \in B(w,\epsilon)$ can be
      connected to $z_0$ by a parametric curve (from $w_1$ to $w$, then from $w$
      to $z_0$ via $\gamma$) that remains in $G$.  This proves that
      $B(w,\epsilon)\subset \Omega$, so $\Omega$ is open.

      ($\Omega$ is closed) We show $G \setminus \Omega$ is open 
      (and thus, in fact, empty).  
      If $z \in G \setminus \Omega$, then, since $G$ is open,
      $\exists \delta >0$ such that $B(z,\delta)\subset G$.  We want
      $B(z,\delta)\subset G \setminus \Omega$.  This must be true since,
      otherwise, there would be a point $z_1 \in B(z,\delta) \intersect \Omega$ 
      which could be connected to both $z$ and $z_0$ by parametric curves in
      $G$.  But then a parametric curve in $G$ connecting $z$ to $z_0$ could be
      constructed, which would put $z$ in $\Omega$ -- a contradiction.

      We have thus shown that $\Omega$ is both open and closed in $G$, as well as
      non-empty. Since $G$ is connected, $\Omega = G$. 
      \qed
