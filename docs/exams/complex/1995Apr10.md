   (a) Suppose that $|f(z)| \leq A |z|^N + B$ for all $z\in \mathbb C$ where $A, B$ are finite constants.  Show that $f$ is a polynomial of degree $N$ or less.\
   (b) Suppose that $f$ satisfies the condition: $|f(z_n)|\rightarrow \infty$ whenever $|z_n| \rightarrow \infty$.  Show that $f$ is a polynomial.

2. (a) State a form of the Cauchy theorem.\
   (b) State a converse of the Cauchy theorem.

SOLUTION 1.
   
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      \index{Cauchy's formula!applied}
      {\bf (a)} By Cauchy's formula, we have 
      \[
      a_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{|\zeta| = R} \frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta^{n+1}}\, d\zeta,
      \]
      for every $R>0$.  Therefore,
      % \begin{align*}
      \begin{equation*}
        % \label{eq:100}
        |a_n| \leq  \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{|\zeta| = R} \frac{|f(\zeta)|}{|\zeta|^{n+1}}\,|d\zeta|\\[4pt]
        \leq  \frac{1}{2\pi} \, \frac{A\, R^N + B}{R^{n+1}}\, 2\pi R\\[4pt]
        = A \,R^{N-n} + B \, R^{-n}.
        % \end{align*}
      \end{equation*}
      Again, this holds for every $R>0$.  Thus, for any $n>N$ and 
      $\epsilon >0$, taking $R$ large enough forces $|a_n| < \epsilon$ ($n=N+1, N+2,
      \dots$).  Since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, we have $a_n = 0$ for all $n=N+1,
      N+2,\dots$.  Therefore,
      $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^N a_n z^n$. 
      \qed
      ~\\
      {\bf (b)} We give three different proofs.  The first is the shortest, but relies
      on the heaviest machinery.\\[4pt]
      \index{Casorati-Weierstrass theorem!applied}
      {\it Proof 1:} If we take for granted that any transcendental
      (i.e.~non-polynomial) entire function has an essential singularity at infinity,
      then the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem (see 3 of Nov.~'01) implies that, for any
      complex number $w$, there is a sequence $\{z_n\}$
      with $z_n\rightarrow \infty$ and $f(z_n)\rightarrow w$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$.  
      Since this contradicts the given hypotheses, $f(z)$ cannot be a transcendental
      function.  That is, $f(z)$ must be a polynomial.
      \qed
      ~\\
      {\it Proof 2:} Since $f\in H(\C)$, the series
      % $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ converges locally uniformly in $\C$.  The
      $f(z) = \sum a_n z^n$ converges locally uniformly in $\C$.  The
      hypotheses imply that the function $f(1/z)$ has a pole at $z=0$.  Let 
      \[
      g(z) = f(1/z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty b_n z^n
      \]
      be the Laurent series expansion of the function $g$ about $z=0$.  Suppose the
      pole at $z=0$ is of order $m$.  Clearly $m$ is finite, by the criterion for a pole
      (\ie $\lim_{z\rightarrow 0} f(1/z) = \infty$).  Therefore, we can write
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:200}
        g(z) = f(1/z) = \sum_{n=-m}^\infty b_n z^n = b_{-m}z^{-m} + b_{-m+1}z^{-m+1} +
        \cdots b_{-1}z^{-1} + b_0 + b_1 z + \cdots
      \end{equation}
      Now $f$ is entire, so it has the form $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty
      a_n z^n$, which  implies that 
      $f(1/z) =  a_0 + a_1z^{-1} + a_2 z^{-2} + \cdots$.
      Compared with (\ref{eq:200}),
      \[
      a_0 + a_1z^{-1} + a_2 z^{-2} + \cdots  = f(1/z) =  b_{-m}z^{-m} +
      b_{-m+1}z^{-m+1} + \cdots b_{-1}z^{-1} + b_0 + b_1 z + \cdots
      \]
      That is, $0 = a_{m+1} = a_{m+2} = \cdots$, so 
      \[
      f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^m a_n z^n.
      \]
      {\it Proof 3:} By the hypotheses, there is an $R>0$ such that $|f(z)|>0$ for all
      $|z|>R$.  Therefore, the zeros of $f$ are confined to a closed disk
      $\overline{D}_R = \{|z|\leq R\}$.  Since the zeros of $f$ are isolated, there are
      at most finitely many of them in any compact subset of $\C$.  In particular, 
      $\overline{D}_R$ contains only finitely many zeros of $f$.  This proves that $f$
      has only finitely many zeros in $\C$.

      Let $\{\alpha_1,\dots, \alpha_N\}$ be the collections of all zeros of $f$
      (counting multiplicities).  Consider the function
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:400}
        g(z) = \frac{f(z)}{(z-\alpha_1)\cdots (z-\alpha_N)}.
      \end{equation}
      This is defined and holomorphic in $\C\setminus \{\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_N\}$,
      but the $\alpha_i$'s are removable singularities, so $g(z)$ is a nonzero entire
      function. In particular, for any $R>0$,
      % Next note that, as $g(z) \in H(\C)$ and $g(z)\neq 0$ $(z\in \C)$, it is
      % clear that, 
      \[
      \min_{z\in D_R} |g(z)|\geq \min_{|z|=R}|g(z)| = \epsilon > 0,
      \]
      for some $\epsilon>0$.  Therefore, $1/g$ is a bounded entire function, hence
      \index{Liouville's theorem!applied}
      constant, by Liouville's theorem.  What we have shown is that the left hand side of
      (\ref{eq:400}) is constant, and this proves that $f(z)$ is a polynomial.
      \qed

      {\it Remark:} A nice corollary to part (b) is the following:

      \begin{corollary}
        If $f$ is an injective entire function, then $f(z) = a z + b$ for some constants
        $a$ and $b$.
      \end{corollary}
      The proof appears below in section \ref{sec:limiting-behavior}.

SOLUTION 3.
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      {\bf (a)} This is a special case of the following area theorem:
      \index{area theorem}
      \begin{theorem}%[Area theorem]
        Suppose $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ is a holomorphic function which maps the unit disk
        $\UD = \{|z|<1\}$ bijectively onto a domain $f(\UD) = G$ having
        area $A$.  Then
        \[
        A = \pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty n |a_n|^2.
        \]
      \end{theorem}
      \begin{proof}
        The area of the image of $\UD$ under $f$ is the integral over $\UD$ of the Jacobian of $f$.
        That is, 
        \[
        A = \iint_{\UD} |f'(z)|^2 \, dx \,dy.
        \]
        Compute $|f'(z)|$ by differentiating the power series of $f(z)$ term by term,
        \[
        f'(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n a_n z^{n-1}.
        \] 
        Next, take the squared modulus,
        \[
        |f'(z)|^2 = \sum_{m,n=1}^\infty m \, n \, a_m \overline{a}_n z^{m-1} \overline{z}^{n-1}.
        \] 
        This gives,
        \[
        A = \iint_{\UD} \sum_{m,n=1}^\infty m\, n \,a_m \overline{a}_n z^{m-1} \overline{z}^{n-1} \, dx \,dy.
        \]
        Letting $z = r e^{i\theta}$,
        \[
        A = \sum_{m,n=1}^\infty m \, n \, a_m \overline{a}_n \int_0^1\int_0^{2\pi} r^{m+n-1}
        e^{i (m-n)\theta}\, d\theta \,dr.
        \]
        Now, for all $k\neq 0$, the integral of $e^{i k \theta}$ over $0 \leq \theta < 2\pi$
        vanishes, so the only non-vanishing terms of the series are those for which
        $m=n$.  That is,
        \begin{equation}
          \label{eq:500}
          A = 2\pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^2 |a_n|^2 \int_0^1r^{2n-1}  \, dr
          = \pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^2 |a_n|^2.
        \end{equation}
        \qed
      \end{proof}
      To apply this theorem to the problem at hand, note that the hypotheses of the
      problem imply that $f$ maps the unit disk bijectively onto its range $f(\UD)$,
      which is contained inside $\UD$ and, therefore, has area less or equal to $\pi$.
      This and (\ref{eq:500}) together imply
      \[
      \pi \geq \pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^2 |a_n|^2,
      \]
      which gives the desired inequality.\qed
      ~\\[4pt]
      {\bf (b)} The identity function $f(z) = z$ satisfies the given hypotheses and its 
      power series expansion has coefficients $a_1 = 1$ and $0=a_0 = a_2 = a_3 =
      \cdots$.  This shows that the upper bound of 1 is obtained and is therefore the best possible.

SOLUTION 4.

  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      Suppose, by way of contradiction, that there is no such sequence.  Then $u(z)$ is
      bounded away from zero for all $z$ in some neighborhood of infinity, say, $\{|z|>R\}$, for
      some $R>0$.  Since $u$ is continuous, either $u(z)>0$ for all $|z|>R$, or
      $u(z) < 0$ for all $|z|>R$.  Assume without loss of generality that $u(z)>0$ for
      all $|z|>R$. 

      Since $u$ is continuous on the compact set $\{|z|\leq R\}$, it attains its
      minimum on that set.  Thus, there is an $M>0$ such that $-M\leq u(z)$ for all
      $|z|\leq R$.  Consider the function $U(z) = u(z) + M$.  By construction,
      $U(z)\geq 0$ for all $z\in \C$, and $U$ is harmonic in $\C$.
      But this implies $U(z)$, hence $u(z)$, must be constant.\footnote{Recall problem 1(b), April
        '89, where we proved that a real valued harmonic function $u(z)$ satisfying
        $u(z)\geq 0$ for all $z\in \C$ must be constant.} This contradicts the
      hypothesis that $u(z)$ be nonconstant and completes the proof.

SOLUTOIN 6.

  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      {\bf (a)} See theorem~\ref{thm:schwarz}.
      \\[4pt]
      {\bf (b)} Assume $f$ satisfies the given hypotheses.  In particular,
      $f(0)=\frac{1}{2}$.   Consider the map
      \[
      \varphi(z) = \frac{\frac{1}{2} - z}{1-\frac{z}{2}}.
      \]
      This is a holomorphic bijection of the unit disk, with $\phi(1/2) = 0$.
      Therefore, $g = \varphi \circ f$ satisfies the hypotheses of Schwarz's lemma.  In
      particular, $|g'(0)| \leq 1$.  Since $g'(z) = \varphi'(f(z))f'(z)$, we have
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:300}
        1 \geq |g'(0)| = |\varphi'(1/2)| |f'(0)|.
      \end{equation}
      Now, 
      \[
      \varphi'(z) =
      \frac{-\left(1-\frac{z}{2}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}-z\right)}
      {\left(1-\frac{z}{2}\right)^2}.
      \]
      Therefore, $\varphi'(1/2) = -4/3$, and it follows from~(\ref{eq:300}) that 
      \[
      |f'(0)| \leq \frac{1}{|\varphi'(1/2)|} = 3/4.
      \]
      \qed
