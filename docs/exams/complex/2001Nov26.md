**Instructions.** Make a substantial effort on all parts of the following problems.  If you cannot completely answer Part (a) of a problem, it is still possible to do Part (b). Partial credit is given for partial progress.  Include as many details as time permits.  Throughout the exam, $z$ denotes a complex variable, and $\mathbb C$ denotes the complex plane.

1. (a) Suppose that $f(z) = f(x+iy) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)$ where $u$ and $v$ are $C^1$ functions defined on a neighborhood of the closure of a bounded region $G\subset \mathbb C$ with boundary which is parametrized by a properly oriented, piecewise $C^1$ curve $\gamma$.  If $u$ and $v$ obey the Cauchy-Riemann equations, show that Cauchy's theorem $\int_\gamma f(z) \ dz = 0$ follows from Green's theorem, namely $$\int_\gamma P\ dx + Q\ dy = \int_G  \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)\ dx\ dy,$$ for $C^1$ functions $P$ and $Q$.\
   (b) Suppose that we do *not* assume that $u$ and $v$ are $C^1$, but merely that $u$ and $v$ are continuous in $G$ and $$f'(z_0) = \lim_{z\rightarrow z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z-z_0}$$ exists at some (possibly only one!) point $z_0 \in G$. Show that given any $\epsilon >0$, we can find a triangular region $\Delta$ containing $z_0$, such that if $T$ is the boundary curve of $\Delta$, then $$\left|\int_T f(z)\ dz\right| = \frac{\epsilon L^2}{2},$$ where $L$ is the length of the perimeter of $\Delta$. (Hint: Note that part (a) yields $\int_T (az+b) \ dz =0$ for $a, b \in \mathbb C$, which you can use here in (b), even if you could not do Part (a). You may also use the fact that $\left|\int_T g(z)\ dz\right|  \leq L \cdot \sup\\{|g(z)|:z\in T\\}$ for $g$ continuous on $T$.)

2. Give *two* quite different proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that if a polynomial with complex coefficients has no complex zero, then it is constant.  You may use independent, well-known theorems and principles such as Liouville's Theorem, the Argument Principle, the Maximum Principle, Rouche's Theorem, and/or the Open Mapping Theorem.

3. (a) State and prove the Casorati-Weierstrass Theorem concerning the image of any punctured disk about a certain type of isolated singularity of an analytic function.  You may use the fact that if a function $g$ is analytic and bounded in the neighborhood of a point $z_0$, then $g$ has a removable singularity at $z_0$.\
   (b) Verify the Casorati-Weierstrass Theorem directly for a specific analytic function of your choice, with a suitable singularity.

4. (a) Define $\gamma : [0,2\pi] \rightarrow \mathbb C$ by $\gamma(t) = \sin (2t) + 2i \sin (t)$.  This is a parametrization of a "figure 8" curve, traced out in a regular fashion.  Find a meromorphic function $f$ such that $\int_\gamma f(z) \ dz = 1$. Be careful with minus signs and factors of $2\pi i$.\
   (b) From the theory of Laurent expansions, it is known that there are constants $a_n$ such that, for $1<|z|<4$, $$\frac{1}{z^2 - 5z + 4} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_n z^n.$$ Find $a_{-10}$ and $a_{10}$ by the method of your choice.
  <!-- \index{Laurent expansion} -->

5. (a) Suppose that $f$ is analytic on a region $G\subset \mathbb C$ and $\\{z\in \mathbb C: |z-a|\leq R\\} \subset G$.  Show that if $|f(z)| \leq M$ for all $z$ with $|z-a|=R$, then for any  $w_1, w_2\in \\{z\in \mathbb C: |z-a|\leq \frac{1}{2}R\\}$, we have $$|f(w_1) - f(w_2)| \leq \frac{4M}{R} |w_1 - w_2|.$$
   (b) Explain how Part (a) can be used with the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem to prove Montel's Theorem asserting the normality of any locally bounded family $F$ of analytic functions on a region $G$.

SOLUTION 1.
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      {\bf (a)} Let $P=u$ and $Q= -v$ in~(\ref{eq:2001-1-1}).  Then,
      by the Cauchy-Riemann equations,\footnote{These 
        \index{Cauchy-Riemann equations}
        are $u_x = v_y$ and $u_y = -v_x$. 
        % If you forget where the minus sign goes, just
        % remember that $z=x+iy$ is analytic.
      }
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:2001-1-2}
        \int_\gamma u(x,y)\, dx - v(x,y) \, dy= \int_G (v_x + u_y) \, dx\, dy = 0.
      \end{equation}
      Similarly, if $P=v$ and $Q=u$ in Green's theorem, then the Cauchy-Riemann
      equations imply
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:2001-1-3}
        \int_\gamma v(x,y)\, dx + u(x,y) \, dy= \int_G (u_x - v_y) \, dx\, dy = 0.
      \end{equation}
      Next, note that 
      \[
      f(z)\, dz = [u(x,y)+iv(x,y)]\, d(x+iy)  
      = u(x,y)\, dx - v(x,y)\, dy
      +i [v(x,y)\, dx + u(x,y)\, dy].
      \]
      Therefore, by (\ref{eq:2001-1-2}) and (\ref{eq:2001-1-3}), 
      \[
      \int_\gamma f(z)\, dz = \int_\gamma u(x,y)\, dx - v(x,y)\, dy
      +i \int_\gamma v(x,y)\, dx + u(x,y)\, dy = 0.
      \]
      \qed~\\[4pt]
      \index{Cauchy's theorem!proof by Green's theorem|)} 
      {\bf (b)}  Suppose $u$ and $v$ are continuous and $f'(z)$ exists at the point $z_0\in G$. 
      Then, for any $\epsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that 
      $B(z_0,\delta)\subseteq G$, and 
      \[
      \left| f'(z_0) - \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z-z_0}\right| < \epsilon, \quad \text{ for
        all $|z- z_0|< \delta$.}
      \]
      Pick a triangular region $\Delta \subset B(z_0,\delta)$
      with $z_0\in \Delta$, and let $T$ be the boundary.
      Define 
      \[
      R(z) = f(z) - [f(z_0) + f'(z_0) (z-z_0)].
      \]
      \index{Cauchy's theorem!problems}
      Then, by Cauchy's theorem (part (a)), $\int_T [f(z_0) + f'(z_0) (z-z_0)] \, dz =
      0$, whence $\int_T R(z)\, dz = \int_T f(z)\, dz$.
      Finally, note that 
      \[
      \left|\frac{R(z)}{z-z_0}\right| = 
      \left| f'(z_0) - \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z-z_0}\right| < \epsilon, \quad \text{ for
        all $|z- z_0|< \delta$.}
      \]
      Therefore,
      \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
      \begin{eqnarray*}
        \left|\int_T f(z)\, dz\right| &{}={}& \left|\int_T R(z)\, dz \right|
        \leq \int_T |R(z)|\, |dz| \\[4pt]
        &{}={}& \int_T  \left|\frac{R(z)}{z-z_0}\right| |z-z_0|\, |dz| \\[4pt]
        &{}\leq{}& \epsilon \int_T  |z-z_0|\, |dz| \leq \epsilon r L.
      \end{eqnarray*}
      where $L$ denotes the length of the perimeter of $\Delta$ (\ie the length of
      $T$), and $r$ denotes the length of one side of $T$, which must, of course, be
      greater than $|z-z_0|$ for all $z\in T$. Also, the length of one side of $\Delta$
      is surely less than half the length of the perimeter (\ie $r<L/2$).  Therefore,
      \[
      \left|\int_T f(z)\, dz\right| \leq \frac{1}{2}\epsilon L^2.     
      \]\qed
    \end{solution}  }{}

SOLUTION 2.
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      In the two proofs below, we begin by supposing $p(z)$ is not constant and
      thus has the form $p(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + \mathbb Cdots + a_n z^n$ with 
      $a_n \neq 0$ for some $n\geq 1$. Both proofs also rely on the following
      observation:
      If $\{a_j\}_{j=0}^n \subset \mathbb C$ with $a_n\neq 0$, then for all 
      $1\leq R \leq |z| <\infty$,
      \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
      \begin{eqnarray*}
        \left|\frac{a_0}{a_n} z^{-n} + \mathbb Cdots +\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} z^{-1}\right|
        &{}\leq{}& \frac{|a_0|}{|a_n|} |z|^{-n} + \mathbb Cdots +\frac{|a_{n-1}|}{|a_n|} |z|^{-1}\\[4pt]
        &{}\leq{}& n \max_{0\leq j <n} \frac{|a_j|}{|a_n|}|z|^{-1} \\[4pt]
        &{}\leq{}& n \max_{0\leq j <n} \frac{|a_j|}{|a_n|}R^{-1}.
      \end{eqnarray*}
      In particular, if we choose\footnote{Note, we add 1 here just to be sure 
        $R$ is safely over 1.}
      % The proofs presented here are quite concrete,
      % and perhaps a bit heavy handed. For example, we compute a
      % specific $R>0$ with some desired properties.  Of course, we needn't compute
      % such an $R$ to convince ourselves that it exists.  The proof in Conway is much
      % more elegant, and probably no 
      % less convincing.  He simply notes that if $p(z)$ is a non-constant polynomial
      % then $\lim{z\rightarrow \infty} p(z)=\infty$ and, therefore
      $R = 1+ 2\, n \,\max_{0\leq j <n} |a_j|/|a_n|$, then
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:2001-2-0}
        \left|\frac{a_0}{a_n} z^{-n} + \mathbb Cdots +\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} z^{-1}\right| \leq 1/2,
        \quad \text{ for all $|z| \geq R$.}
      \end{equation}~\\[4pt]

      {\it Proof 1:}  Assume $p(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + \mathbb Cdots + a_n z^n$ with 
      $a_n \neq 0$ for some $n\geq 1$, and 
      let $R = 1+ 2\, n \,\max_{0\leq j <n} |a_j|/|a_n|$, as above.
      We claim that
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:2001-2-1}
        |p(z) - a_n z^n| < |a_n z^n|, \quad \text{ for all $|z|=R$.}     
      \end{equation}
      To see this, check that
      \[
      \frac{|p(z) - a_n z^n|}{|a_n z^n|}
      = \left|\frac{a_0}{a_n} z^{-n} + \mathbb Cdots +\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} z^{-1}\right| < 1,
      \quad \text{ for all $|z|=R$.}     
      \]
      In fact, (\ref{eq:2001-2-0}) implies that the sum is no greater than 1/2, for all
      $|z|\geq R$, which is more than we need.
      Now (\ref{eq:2001-2-1}) and Rouch\'{e}'s theorem \index{Rouch\'{e}'s theorem} 
      imply that the function $g(z) = a_nz^n$ has the same number of zeros in $|z|<R$
      as does the function $p(z)$. Clearly $z=0$ is a zero of
      $g(z)$ (of multiplicity $n$).  Therefore, $p(z)$ has a zero in $|z|<R$.
      \qed~\\
      {\it Proof 2:}\footnote{Conway~\mathbb Cite{Conway:1978} (p.~77) presents a similar, but
        more elegant proof.}   Assume $p(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + \mathbb Cdots + a_n z^n$ with 
      $a_n \neq 0$ for some $n\geq 1$, and consider 
      % \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
      % \begin{eqnarray*}
      %   |p(z)| &{}={}& |a_n z^n| \left|\frac{a_0}{a_n}z^{-n} + \mathbb Cdots + \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} z^{-1} + 1\right|\\[4pt]
      %   &{}\geq{}& |a_n||z|^n \left| 1 -
      %     |\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\frac{a_j}{a_n}z^{-n+j}|\,\right|.
      % \end{eqnarray*}
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:2001-2-2}
        |p(z)| = |a_n z^n| \left|\frac{a_0}{a_n}z^{-n} + \mathbb Cdots + \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} z^{-1} + 1\right|
        \geq |a_n||z|^n \left| 1 - |\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\frac{a_j}{a_n}z^{-n+j}|\,\right|.
      \end{equation}
      If we choose $R = 1+ 2\, n \,\max_{0\leq j <n} |a_j|/|a_n|$ as above, 
      then 
      % by~(\ref{eq:2001-2-0}),
      \[
      0\leq \left|\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\frac{a_j}{a_n}z^{-n+j}\right| 
      = \left|\frac{a_0}{a_n} z^{-n} + \mathbb Cdots +\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} z^{-1}\right| \leq 1/2,
      \quad \text{ for all $|z|\geq R$,}
      \]
      and (\ref{eq:2001-2-2}) becomes $|p(z)| \geq |a_n||z|^n/2$, for all $|z|\geq R$.
      Therefore, the function $f(z) \triangleq 1/p(z)$  satisfies
      \[
      |f(z)| = \frac{1}{|p(z)|} \leq \frac{2}{|a_n||z|^n}, \quad
      \text{ for all $|z|\geq R$.}
      \]
      Now suppose $p(z)$ has no complex zero.  Then $f(z) \in H(\mathbb C)$. In particular, $f(z)$
      is continuous, hence bounded on the compact set $|z|\leq R$.  Therefore $f(z)$ is a
      bounded entire function, so, by Liouville's theorem,
      \index{Liouville's theorem!applied}
      it must be constant, but then $p(z)$ must be constant.  This contradicts our
      initial assumption and proves that $p(z)$ must have a complex zero.
      \qed

      In fact, we have proved a bit more: If $p(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + \mathbb Cdots + a_n z^n$ 
      with $a_n \neq 0$ for some $n\geq 1$, and $R$ is either 1 or
      $R = 2\, n \,\max_{0\leq j <n} |a_j|/|a_n|$ (whichever is greater), then
      $p(z)$ vanishes for some $|z|< R$, while for all $|z|\geq R$, $|p(z)|$ is bounded
      from below by $|a_n||z|^n/2$.  Thus all the zeros of $p(z)$ are contained in
      the disk $|z|< R$.

      \begin{theorem}[Casorati-Weierstrass] If $f$ is a holomorphic function in a
        region $G\in \mathbb C$ except for an essential singularity at the point $z=z_0$, then
        for any $w\in \mathbb C$ there is a sequence $\{z_n\}\subset G$ approaching $z_0$ such
        that $f(z_n)\rightarrow w$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$.
      \end{theorem}
      {\it Proof:}  Fix $w_0\in \mathbb C$ and suppose there is no sequence $\{z_n\}\subset G$ approaching
      $z_0$ such that $f(z_n)\rightarrow w_0$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$.  Then there is a
      punctured disk $\bar{D_0} \triangleq B(z_0,\epsilon)\setminus \{z_0\} \subset G$
      such that $|f(z)-w_0|>\delta >0$ for all $z\in \bar{D_0}$.  Define
      $g(z) = 1/(f(z) - w_0)$ on $D_0$.  Then 
      \[
      \limsup_{\substack{z\rightarrow z_0\\ z\in D_0}} |g(z)| = 
      \limsup_{\substack{z\rightarrow z_0\\ z\in D_0}} \frac{1}{|f(z) - w_0|}\leq \frac{1}{\delta} < \infty.
      \]
      Thus, by lemma~\ref{lem:removable-singularity} (Nov.~'06, prob.~1), $z_0$ is a removable
      singularity of $g(z)$.  Therefore, $g(z) \in H(B(z_0, \epsilon))$. In particular,
      $g$ is continuous and non-zero at $z=z_0$, so it is non-zero in a neighborhood
      $B(z_0,\epsilon_0)$ of $z_0$.  Therefore, $f(z)-w_0 = 1/g(z)$ is holomorphic in 
      $B(z_0,\epsilon_0)$, which implies that the singularity of $f(z)$ at $z=z_0$ is
      removable. This contradiction proves the theorem.
      \qed~\\[4pt]
      {\bf (b)} Consider $f(z) = e^z$.  This function has an essential singularity at
      $\infty$, and, for every horizontal strip,
      % (If you prefer, consider $g(z) = f(1/z) = e^{1/z}$ which has its
      % essential singularity at $z=0$.)
      \[
      S_\alpha = \{x+iy: x\in \R, \, \alpha \leq y < \alpha + 2\pi\},
      \]
      of width $2\pi$, $f(z)$ maps $S_\alpha$ onto $\mathbb C\setminus \{0\}$.  (In particular,
      $f(z)$ comes arbitrarily close to every $w\in \mathbb C$.)  Now let $\sigN_R = \{z\in \mathbb C:
      |z|>R\}$ be any neighborhood of $\infty$.  There is clearly a strip $S_\alpha$
      contained in $\sigN_R$ (\eg with $\alpha = R+1$).  Therefore, $f(z)=e^z$ maps
      points in $\sigN_R$ to points arbitrarily close (in fact equal when $w\neq 0$)
      to all points $w\in \mathbb C$.

      {\bf (a)} Let $G$ be the region whose boundary is the curve $\gamma$, and suppose 
      $f(z) \in H(\mathbb C)$ except for isolated singularities at the points  
      $\{z_1, \ldots, z_n\}\subset G$. By the residue theorem, \index{residue theorem!applied}
      \[
      \int_\gamma f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \sum_{j=1}^n \mbox{Res}(f,z_j).
      \]
      Therefore, if we were to find a function $f(z)\in H(\mathbb C)$ with exactly two isolated
      singularities in $G$ (\eg at $z_1=i$ and $z_2=-i$), and such that 
      $\mbox{Res}(f,z_j)=\frac{-i}{4\pi}$, then 
      \[
      \int_\gamma f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \sum_j \mbox{Res}(f,z_j) = 2\pi i
      \left(\frac{-i}{4\pi}+\frac{-i}{4\pi}\right) = 1,
      \]
      and the problem would be solved. Clearly,

      {\bf (b)} Expand the function in partial fractions:
      \[

      \frac{1/3}{z-4}- \frac{1/3}{z-1}.

      -\frac{1}{12} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{z}{4}\right)^n

      converges for $|z|<4$, while
      \[
      \frac{1/3}{z-1} = -\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{z(1-1/z)} = 
      -\frac{1}{3z} \sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{-n}
      \]
      converges for $|z|>1$.  Therefore,
      \[
      \frac{1}{z^2 - 5z + 4} =
      -\frac{1}{3} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{-1} z^{n}
      -\frac{1}{12} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^n z^n
      , \quad \text{ for $1<|z|<4$.}
      \]

      \therefore \quad a_{-10} = -\frac{1}{3} \qquad \text{and} \qquad 
      a_{10} = -\frac{1}{12}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{10}.

      {\bf (b)}\footnote{The best treatment of normal families and the
        Arzela-Ascoli theorem is Ahlfors~\mathbb Cite{Ahlfors:1968}.}
      % (from which the solution to this problem is adapted).
      We must explain how part (a) can be used with the 
      Arzela-Ascoli theorem to prove Montel's theorem
      asserting the normality of any locally bounded family $\FT \subset H(G)$.
      \index{Arzela-Ascoli theorem|ii}
      \begin{theorem}[Arzela-Ascoli]
        \label{thm:arzela-ascoli}
        Let $\FT\subset C(G, S)$ be a family of continuous functions from an open
        set $G\subseteq \mathbb C$ into a metric space $(S,d)$.  Then $\FT$ is a normal
        family if and only if\\
        \phantom{xx}(i) $\FT$ is equicontinuous on each compact subset of $G$, and\\
        \phantom{xx}(ii) for each $z\in G$, the set $\{f(z):f\in \FT\}$ is contained in a
        compact subset of $S$.
      \end{theorem}

      Recall that a family $\FT$ of functions is called {\it locally bounded} on $G$
      iff for all compact $K\subset G$ there is a constant $M_K$ such that
      $|f(z)|\leq M_K$ for all $f\in \FT$ and $z\in K$.

      \index{Montel's theorem|ii}
      \begin{corollary}[little Montel theorem]
        \label{cor:montel}
        Assume the set-up of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, and suppose $S=\mathbb C$ and
        $\FT\subset H(G)$. Then $\FT$ is a normal family if and only if it is
        locally bounded. 
      \end{corollary}

      Because of the way the
      problem is stated, it is probably enough to prove just one direction of
      Montel's theorem; \ie local boundedness implies normality.  
      For a proof of the other direction, 
      see Conway~\mathbb Cite{Conway:1978}, page 153.

      Let $S = \mathbb C$ in the Arzela-Ascoli theorem.  In that case, $K\subset \mathbb C$ is
      compact if and only if $K$ is closed and bounded.  Therefore, if $\FT$ is 
      locally bounded, condition (ii) of the theorem is clearly satisfied.  To check that local
      boundedness also implies condition (i), we use part (a).

      It suffices 
      (why?)\footnote{Answer: If, instead of a single point 
        $a\in G$, we are given a compact set $K\subset G$, then there is a finite 
        cover $\{B(a_j,r_j):j=1,\ldots, n\}$ by such neighborhoods with equicontinuity
        constants $\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_n$.  Then, $\delta = \min_j\delta_j$, is a
        single equicontinuity constant that works for all of $K$.}
      to prove that for any $a\in G$ there is a neighborhood $B(a,r)$ in
      which $\FT$ is equicontinuous with equicontinuity 
      constant\footnote{The careful reader might note the distinction between
        this type of ``uniform'' equicontinuity, which is taken for granted in complex
        analysis texts, \eg Ahlfors~\mathbb Cite{Ahlfors:1968} and Rudin~\mathbb Cite{Rudin:1987}, 
        and the ``pointwise'' equicontinuity discussed in topology
        \index{equicontinuity!pointwise vs. uniform}
        books like the one by Munkres~\mathbb Cite{Munkres}.  To make peace with this
        apparent discrepancy, check that the two notions coincide when the set on which a family
        of functions is declared equicontinuous is compact.}
      $\delta$. So, fix $a\in G$ and $\epsilon >0$, and let $\bar{B}(a,R)\subset G$.
      Then, by local boundedness, there is an $M>0$ such that $|f(z)|\leq M$ for all 
      $z \in \bar{B}(a,R)$ and all $f\in \FT$.  Therefore, by part (a),
      \[
      |f(w_1)-f(w_2)| \leq \frac{4M}{R}|w_1-w_2|, \quad 
      \text{ for all $w_1, w_2 \in \{|w-a|\leq R/2\}$.}
      \]
      If $\delta = \frac{R}{4M}\epsilon$ and $r = R/2$, then
      $|f(w_1)-f(w_2)| < \epsilon$ whenever 
      $w_1, w_2 \in B(a,r)$ and $|w_1-w_2|< \delta$.  Therefore, $\FT$ is
      equicontinuous in $B(a,r)$.
      We have thus shown that local boundedness implies conditions (i) and (ii) of the
      Arzela-Ascoli theorem and thereby implies normality.
