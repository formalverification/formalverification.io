      \index{removable singularity theorem}
      \begin{lemma}
        \label{lem:removable-singularity}
        Suppose $G\subset \mathbb C$ is an open set and $f$ is
        holomorphic in $G$ except for an isolated singularity at $z_0 \in G$.
        If 
        \[
        \limsup_{\substack{z\rightarrow z_0\\ z\in G}} |f(z)| < \infty,
        \]
        then $z_0$ is a removable singularity and $f$ may be extended
        holomorphically to all of $G$.
      \end{lemma}
      {\it Proof:} Under the stated hypotheses, there is an $\epsilon >0$ and
      an $M > 0$ such that the deleted neighborhood 
      $B^o \triangleq \\{z\in \mathbb C : 0 < |z-z_0| \leq \epsilon\\}$ 
      is contained in $G$ and such that $|f(z)| \leq M$ for all $z\in B^o$.  

      Let 
      \[
      f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_n (z-z_0)^n
      \]
      be the Laurent expansion \index{Laurent expansion}
      of $f$ for $z\in B^o$, where
      \[
      a_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C \frac{f(\zeta)}{(\zeta - z_0)^{n+1}} d\zeta.
      \]
      Here $C$ denotes the positively oriented circle $|\zeta -z_0|=\epsilon$.
      Changing variables,  
      \[ \zeta = z_0 + \epsilon e^{i\theta} \quad \Rightarrow \quad d\zeta =
      i\,\epsilon e^{i\theta} d\theta\] 
      the coefficients are
      \[
      a_n = \frac{1}{2\pi\, i} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{f(z_0 + \epsilon e^{i\theta})}
      {(z_0 + \epsilon e^{i\theta} - z_0)^{n+1}} \; i \epsilon e^{i\theta} d\theta.
      \]
      Therefore,
      \[
      |a_n| \leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{M}{\epsilon^{n+1}} \,
      \epsilon d|\theta| = \frac{M}{\epsilon^n},
      \]
      which makes it clear that, if $n<0$, then $|a_n|$ can be made
      arbitrarily small, by choosing a sufficiently small $\epsilon$.  This
      proves that $a_n = 0$ for negative $n$, and so
      \[
      f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n (z-z_0)^n.
      \]
      Thus, $f\in H(G)$. \qed
      
      The lemma solves part (a) and is also an example of a general theorem about
      isolated singularities of holomorphic functions, so it answers part (b).  Here is
      another answer to part (b):

      \index{criterion for a pole}
      \begin{theorem}[Criterion for a pole] Let $G\subset \mathbb C$ be open.
        and suppose $f(z)$ is holomorphic for all $z\in G$ except for an isolated
        singularity at $z=z_0\in G$. Then
        \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item $z_0$ is a pole of $f$ if and only if 
          $\lim_{z\rightarrow z_0} |f(z)| = \infty$;
        \item if $m>0$ is the smallest integer such that $\varlimsup_{z\rightarrow z_0} |(z-z_0)^m f(z)|$
          remains bounded, then $z_0$ is a pole of order $m$.
        \end{enumerate}
      \end{theorem}

SOLUTION 2.
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      {\bf (a)}\footnote{This problem also appears in April '89 (3) and April '95 (5).} 
      Let $\phi_0(z) = \frac{1-z}{1+z}$.     
      Our strategy will be to show that $\phi_0$ maps the fourth quadrant onto
      $D \mathbb Cap \Pi^+$, and then to construct a conformal mapping, $f$, of the unit disk onto the
      fourth quadrant. Then the composition $\phi_0\mathbb Circ f$ will have the desired properties.

      Consider the boundary of the first quadrant.  Note that $\phi_0$ maps the real line onto itself.  
      Furthermore, $\phi_0$ takes 0 to 1 and takes $\infty$ to -1.  Since $\phi_0(1) =
      0$, we see that the positive real axis
      $(0,\infty)$ is mapped onto the segment $(-1,1)$.  Now, since $\phi_0$ maps
      the right half-plane $\RHP$ onto the unit disk, it must map the boundary of
      $\RHP$ (\ie the imaginary axis) onto the boundary of the unit disk.
      Thus, as $0\mapsto 1$ and $\infty\mapsto -1$, the positive imaginary axis is
      mapped to either the upper half-circle or the lower half-circle, and similarly
      for the negative imaginary axis.  
      Checking that $\phi_0(i) = -i$, it is clear that the positive imaginary axis is
      mapped to the lower half-circle $\\{e^{i\theta}: -\pi < \theta < 0\\}$.
      Therefore, in mapping the right
      half-plane onto the unit disk, $\phi_0$ maps the first quadrant to the
      lower half-disk $D\mathbb Cap \Pi^-$, and must therefore map the fourth quadrant to the upper
      half-disk.  That is, $\phi_0 : Q_4 \rightarrow D \mathbb Cap \Pi^+$, where 
      $Q_4 = \\{z\in \mathbb C: \Real z > 0, \Imag z <0\\}$.

      Next construct a mapping of the unit disk onto the fourth quadrant as follows:  
      If $\phi_1(z) = iz$, then $\phi_1 \mathbb Circ \phi_0: D \rightarrow \Pi^+$.  
      Let $\phi_2(z) = z^{1/2}$ be a branch of the square root function on $\Pi^+$.  
      Then $\phi_2$ maps $\Pi^+$ onto the first quadrant, 
      $Q_1 = \\{z\in \mathbb C: \Real z > 0, \Imag z >0\\}$.   
      Finally, let $\phi_3(z) = e^{-i\pi/2}z = -iz$, which takes the first quadrant to the fourth
      quadrant.  Then, since all of the mappings are conformal bijections, 
      $f = \phi_3 \mathbb Circ \phi_2 \mathbb Circ \phi_1 \mathbb Circ \phi_0$ is a conformal bijection of $D$
      onto $Q_4$. Therefore, $\phi_0 \mathbb Circ f$ is a conformal bijection of $D$ onto $D \mathbb Cap \Pi^+$.

      (b) (Riemann)\footnote{Look up the precise statement of the Riemann mapping theorem.}
      Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb C$ be a simply connected region such that
      $\Omega \neq \mathbb C$. Then $\Omega$ is conformally equivalent to $D$.  That is,
      there is a conformal bijection, $\phi$, of $\Omega$ onto the unit disk.
      Moreover, if we specify that a particular $z_0\in \Omega$ must be mapped to $0$,
      and we specify the value of $\arg \phi(z_0)$, then the conformal mapping is unique.

      {\bf (a)} See theorem~\ref{thm:schwarz}.
      \\[4pt]
      {\bf (b)} In order to apply the Schwarz lemma, map the disk to the upper half-plane
      with the M\"{o}ebius map $\phi: D \rightarrow \Pi^+$ defined by
      \[ \phi(z) = i\frac{1-z}{1+z}. \]
      Then, $\phi(0) = i$. Therefore, the function 
      $g = f\mathbb Circ \phi: D \xrightarrow{\phi} \Pi^+ \xrightarrow{f} D$ satisfies 
      $|g(z)|\leq 1$ and $g(0) = f(\phi(0)) = f(i) = 0$.  By Schwarz's lemma, then,
      $|g'(0)|\leq 1$.  Finally, observe that
      $g'(z) = f'(\phi(z))\phi'(z)$, and then check that $\phi'(0) = -2i$.  
      Whence, $g'(0) = f'(\phi(0))\phi'(0) = f'(i)(-2i)$, which implies
      $1 \geq |g'(0)| = 2|f'(i)|$. Therefore $|f'(i)|\leq 1/2$.

      %     \footnotetext{If this problem seems hard to you, don't despair.  As far as problems
      %       about normal families go, this is just about the hardest to have appeared in 
      %       the past 15 years of exams.} 
      {\bf (a)} Let $\Omega$ be an open subset of the plane.  A family $\FT$ of functions
      in $\Omega$ is called a {\it normal family} if every sequence of functions in $\FT$
      has a subsequence which converges locally uniformly in $\Omega$.  (The same definition
      applies when the family $\FT$ happens to be contained in 
      $H(\Omega)$.)\footnote{Despite the wording of the problem, the family need
        not satisfy $\FT \subset H(\Omega)$ in order to be normal.} 

      I think of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem as \emph{the} fundamental theorem for normal
      families. However, since the examiners asked specifically about the special case
      when $\FT$ is a family of \emph{holomorphic} functions, they probably had in mind
      the version of Montel's theorem stated below, which is an easy consequence of the
      Arzela-Ascoli theorem.\footnote{Problem 5 (b) of the November 2001 exam
        asks for a proof of Montel's theorem using the Arzela-Ascoli theorem.}
      
      \index{equicontinuous}
      \index{Arzela-Ascoli theorem}
      \begin{theorem}[Arzela-Ascoli]
        Let $\FT\subset C(\Omega, S)$ be a family of continuous functions from an open
        set $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb C$ into a metric space $(S,d)$.  Then $\FT$ is a normal
        family if and only if\\
        \phantom{xx}(i) $\FT$ is equicontinuous on each compact subset of $\Omega$, and\\
        \phantom{xx}(ii) for each $z\in \Omega$, the set $\\{f(z):f\in \FT\\}$ is contained in a
        compact subset of $S$.
      \end{theorem}

      Recall that a family $\FT$ of functions is called {\it locally bounded} on $\Omega$
      iff for all compact $K\subset \Omega$ there is a constant $M_K$ such that
      $|f(z)|\leq M_K$ for all $f\in \FT$ and $z\in K$.

      \index{Montel's theorem}
      \begin{corollary}[little Montel theorem\protect\footnotemark]
        Assume the set-up of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, and suppose $S=\mathbb C$ and
        $\FT\subset H(\Omega)$. Then $\FT$ is a normal family if and only if it is locally bounded.
      \end{corollary}

      \newcommand{\znz}{\ensuremath{|z_n|z}}
      {\bf (b)} Fix a sequence $\\{z_n\\}\subset \Gamma$ with $z_n\rightarrow 0$ as 
      $n\rightarrow \infty$. We must prove $f(z_n)\rightarrow 0$.
      Define $f_n(z) = f(|z_n|z)$. Then, since 
      $z\in \Gamma \Rightarrow |z_n|z\in \Gamma$, 
      we have 
      \[
      |f_n(z)| = |f(\znz)| < 1, \quad \text{for all $z\in \Gamma$ and $n\in \N$.}
      \]
      Therefore, $\FT$ is a normal family in $\Gamma$.  Also note that each $f_n$ is
      holomorphic in $\Gamma$ since $f(tz) \in H(\Gamma)$ for any constant $t>0$.
      Thus, $\FT$ is a normal family of holomorphic functions in $\Gamma$.

      Let $g$ be a normal limit of $\\{f_n\\}$; \ie there is some subsequence $n_k$ such
      that, as $k\rightarrow \infty$, $f_{n_k} \rightarrow g$ locally uniformly in
      $\Gamma$.

      Consider the point $z=i$. Since $f(it)\rightarrow 0$ as $t\downarrow 0$,
      \[
      g(i) = \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} f_{n_k}(i) = 
      \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} f(|z_{n_k}|i) = 0.
      \]
      In fact, for any point $z=iy$ with $y>0$, we have $g(z)=0$.  Since $g$ is
      holomorphic in $\Gamma$, the identity theorem implies that $g\equiv 0$ in
      $\Gamma$. 

      Next, consider
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:06-5-1}
        f_n\left(\frac{z_n}{|z_n|}\right)=
        f\left(|z_n|\frac{z_n}{|z_n|}\right)=
        f(z_n).
      \end{equation}
      The numbers $z_n/|z_n|$ lie in the compact set $\gamma = \\{z\in \Gamma: |z|=1\\}$.
      Since $f_{n_k}\rightarrow g$ uniformly in $\gamma$, for any $\epsilon >0$,
      there is a $K>0$ such that $|f_{n_k}(z) - g(z)| = |f_{n_k}(z)| < \epsilon$,
      for all $k\geq K$ and all $z\in \gamma$.
      That is,
      \[
      \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \sup\\{|f_{n_k}(z)|: z\in \gamma\\}
      \triangleq \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \|f_{n_k}\|_\gamma = 0,
      \]
      and, since $z_{n_k}/|z_{n_k}|\in \gamma$,
      \[
      \left|f_{n_k}\left(\frac{z_{n_k}}{|z_{n_k}|}\right)\right| \leq \|f_{n_k}\|_\gamma.
      \]
      \[
      \therefore \quad \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} f_{n_k}\left(\frac{z_{n_k}}{|z_{n_k}|}\right) = 0.
      \]
      By~(\ref{eq:06-5-1}), then, $\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} f(z_{n_k}) = 0$.

      Finally, recall that $f(z_n)\rightarrow 0$ iff every subsequence $z_{n_j}$ has a further
      subsequence $z_{n_{j_k}}$ such that $f(z_{n_{j_k}})\rightarrow 0$, as 
      $k\rightarrow \infty$.  Now, if $z_{n_j}$ is any subsequence, then $\\{f(z_{n_j})\\}$ is a normal
      family, and, repeating the argument above, there is, indeed, a further subsequence
      $z_{n_{j_k}}$ such that $f(z_{n_{j_k}})\rightarrow 0$.  This completes the proof. \qed 

      \pspace

      {\it Remark:} In the last paragraph, we made use of the fact that a
      sequence converges to zero iff any subsequence has, in turn, a further subsequence that
      converges to zero.  An alternative concluding argument that doesn't rely on this
      result, but proceeds by way of contradiction, runs as follows: Assume we have already shown
      $\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} f(z_{n_k}) = 0$, as above, and suppose $f(z_n)$ does
      not converge to 0 as $n\rightarrow \infty$.  Then there 
      is a $\delta > 0$ and a subsequence $\\{z_{n_j}\\}$ such that
      $|f(z_{n_j})|>\delta$ for all $j\in \N$.  Relabel this subsequence $\\{z_n\\}$.  Then
      $\\{f(z_n)\\}$ is itself a normal family and we can repeat the argument above to get
      a further subsequence $\\{z_{n_k}\\}$ with $\limit{k} f(z_{n_k})=0$.  This
      contradicts the assumption that $|f(z_{n})|>\delta$ for all $n\in \N$.  Therefore,
      $f(z_n) \rightarrow 0$, as desired.
