**Instructions.** In each of sections A, B, and C, do all but one problem.\
**Time Limit.** 2 hours

<!-- In my opinion it is unrealistic to expect students to produce 8 complete, well-written proofs, with only minor flaws, in 2 hours. -->

### SECTION A (Do 3 of the 4 problems.)

1. Where does the function $f(z) = z\ \mathrm{Real} z + \bar{z}\ \mathrm{Imag} z + \bar{z}$ have a complex derivative?  Compute the derivative wherever it exists.

2. (a) Prove that any nonconstant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one root.\
   (b) From (a) it follows that every nonconstant polynomial $P$ has the factorization $$P(z) = a \prod_{n=1}^N (z - \lambda_n),$$ where $a$ and each root $\lambda_n$ are complex constants. Prove that if $P$ has only real coefficients, then $P$ has a factorization $$P(z) = a \prod_{k=1}^K (z - r_k) \prod_{m=1}^M (z^2 - b_m z + c_m),$$ where a and each $r_k, b_m, c_m$ are real constants.

3. Use complex residue methods to compute the integral $$\int_0^\pi \frac{1}{5 + 3 \cos \theta} \ d\theta.$$


4. (a) Explain how to map an infinite strip (i.e., the region strictly between two parallel lines) onto the unit disk    by a one-to-one conformal mapping.\
   (b) Two circles lie outside one another except for common point of tangency.  Explain how to map the region exterior to both circles (including the point at infinity) onto an infinite strip by a one-to-one conformal mapping.


### SECTION B (Do 3 of the 4 problems.)

5. Suppose that $f$ is analytic in the annulus $1< |z|<2$, and that there exists a sequence of polynomials converging to $f$ uniformly on every compact subset of this annulus.  Show that $f$ has an analytic extension to all of the disk $|z|<2$. (See also 1996 April (8).)  

6. Let $f$ be analytic in $|z|<2$, with the only zeros of $f$ being the distinct points $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, of multiplicities $m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n$, respectively, and with each $a_j$ lying in the disk $|z|<1$.  Given that $g$ is analytic in $|z|<2$, what is $$\int_{|z|=1} \frac{f'(z) g(z)}{f(z)}\ dz \quad \text{?}$$ (Verify your answer.)

7. Let $\\{f_n\\}$ be a sequence of analytic functions in the unit disk $D$, and suppose there exists a positive constant $M$ such that $$\int_C |f_n(z)|\ |dz| \leq M$$ for each $f_n$ and for every circle $C$ lying in $D$. Prove that $\\{f_n\\}$ has a subsequence converging uniformly on compact subsets of $D$.
 <!-- \index{normal family} -->

8. State and prove:\
   (a) the mean value property for analytic functions\
   (b) the maximum principle for analytic functions.

### SECTION C (Do 2 of the 3 problems.)

9. Let $X$ be a Hausdorff topological space, let $K$ be a compact subset of $X$, and let $x$ be a point of $X$ not in $K$.  Show that there exist open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $$K \subset U, \; x\in V, \; U\cap V = \emptyset.$$

10. A topological space $X$ satisfies the second axiom of countability.  Prove that every open cover of $X$ has a countable subcover.

11. Let $X$ be a topological space, and let $U$ be a subset of $X$.\
    (a) Show that if an open set intersects the closure of $Y$ then it intersects $Y$.\
    (b) Show that if $Y$ is connected and if $Y\subset Z \subset \bar{Y}$, then $Z$ is connected.

SOLUTION 1.

   
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution} Writing $f$ in terms of the real and imaginary parts of $z =
      x+iy$, we have
      \begin{align*}
        f(x+iy) &= (x+iy)x + (x-iy) y + x-iy\\
        % &= x^2+ixy + xy -iy^2 + x-iy\\
        &= x^2+ xy + x +i (xy -y^2 -y)\\
        &= u(x,y) + i v(x,y),
      \end{align*}
      where $u(x,y)=x^2+ xy + x$ and $v(x,y) = xy -y^2 -y$ are the real and imaginary
      parts of $f$.  Therefore,
      \begin{align}
        u_x&=2x+ y + 1 & v_y &= x - 2y - 1\label{eq:1991-C-1-1}\\
        u_y&=x & v_x &= y.\label{eq:1991-C-1-2}
      \end{align}
      If $f$ is holomorphic in some region, the 
      \index{Cauchy-Riemann equations} 
      Cauchy-Riemann equations ($u_x = v_y$, $u_y = -v_x$) must hold there.
      By~(\ref{eq:1991-C-1-1}) and (\ref{eq:1991-C-1-2}), this requires
      $2x+ y + 1 = x - 2y - 1$ and $x = -y$. Substituting the second equation into the first
      yields $-y+1 = -3y -1$, or $y=-1$.  Then, since $x = -y$, we must have
      $x = 1$. Therefore, $f$ has a complex derivative at $(x,y) = (1, -1)$, or $z =
      1-i$.

      For any region $\Omega \subseteq \C$, we define the linear functional 
      $\partial : H(\Omega) \rightarrow \C$ by $\partial = 
      \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - i \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)$, 
      and recall that, if $f\in H(\Omega)$, then the derivative of $f$ is given by
      $f'(z) = (\partial f)(z)$, $z\in \Omega$.  In the present case,
      \[
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x + y + 1 + iy, \quad 
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x + i(x -2y - 1).
      \]
      Therefore, 
      % $-i \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2y + 1 -x + i x$, and so,
      % \[
      % \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - i \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right) f(x+iy) 
      % = \frac{1}{2}[(3x-y) + i(y-x)].
      % \]
      % \[
      % \partial f(x+iy) 
      % = \frac{1}{2} [(2x + y + 1 + iy) + (2y + 1 -x + i x)]
      % = \frac{1}{2}[(3x-y) + i(y-x)].
      % \]
      $\partial f(x+iy) 
      = \frac{1}{2} [(2x + y + 1 + iy) -i(x + i(x -2y - 1))]
      = \frac{1}{2}[(3x-y) + i(y-x)]$, and finally,
      \[
      % \therefore \; f'(1-i) = \frac{1}{2}(4-2i) = 2-i.
      f'(1-i) = \frac{1}{2}(4-2i) = 2-i.
      \]
      \qed

SOLUTION 3.
  \index{residue theorem!applied}
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      Let $I = \int_0^\pi \frac{1}{5 + 3 \cos \theta} \, d\theta$. Note that 
      $\cos \theta$ is an even function (\ie $\cos(-\theta) = \cos \theta$), 
      so
      \[
      2I = \int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{1}{5 + 3 \cos \theta} \, d\theta.
      \]
      For $z = e^{i\theta}$,
      \[
      \cos \theta = \frac{e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta}}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(z +
      \frac{1}{z}),
      \]
      and $dz = i e^{i\theta} d\theta$, from which it follows that
      \begin{align*}
        2I &= \int_{|z| = 1} \frac{1}{5 + \frac{3}{2}(z + \frac{1}{z})}\,\frac{dz}{iz}\\[6pt]
        &= \frac{1}{i}\int_{|z| = 1} \frac{dz}{5z + \frac{3}{2}(z^2 + 1)}\\[6pt]
        &= \frac{2}{3i}\int_{|z| = 1} \frac{dz}{z^2 + \frac{10}{3}z + 1}.
      \end{align*}
      Let $p(z) = z^2 + \frac{10}{3}z + 1$.  Then the roots of $p(z)$ are $z_1 = -1/3$
      and $z_2=-3$.  Only $z_1 = -1/3$ is inside the circle $|z| = 1$, so the residue
      theorem implies 
      \[
      2I = \frac{2}{3i} \cdot 2\pi i \cdot \mbox{Res}\left(\frac{1}{p(z)}, z_1\right).
      \]
      Now,
      \[
      \frac{1}{p(z)} = \frac{1}{(z-z_1)(z-z_2)},
      \]
      which implies
      \[
      \mbox{Res}
      \left(\frac{1}{p(z)}, z_1\right) = \lim_{z\rightarrow z_1} \frac{1}{z-z_2} =
      \frac{1}{-\frac{1}{3} - (-3)} = 
      \frac{3}{8}.
      \]
      Therefore, 
      \[
      2I = \frac{2}{3i} \cdot 2\pi i \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{\pi}{2},
      \]
      so $I = \frac{\pi}{4}$.

SOLUTION 5.
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      % Let $A(0;1:2) = \{z\in \C: 1< |z|<2\}$.  
      Note that the function $f$, being holomorphic in the annulus $1<|z|<2$, has Laurent
      series representation
      \[
      f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_n (z - z_0)^n,
      \]
      converging locally uniformly for $1< |z|<2$, where
      $z_0$ is any point in the disk $|z|<2$.
      I claim that $a_n = 0$ for all negative integers $n$.  To see this, first recall
      the formula for the coefficients in the Laurent series,
      \[
      a_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{|z|=R} \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{n+1}} \, dz, \quad
      (n\in \Z;\, 1<R<2).
      \]
      Let $\{p_m\}$ be the sequence of polynomials mentioned in the problem statement.
      Of course, $p_m \in H(\C)$, so Cauchy's theorem implies 
      \index{Cauchy's theorem!problems}
      $\int_{|z|=R} p_m(z)\, dz = 0$, and, more generally,
      \[
      \int_{|z|=R} p_m(z)(z-z_0)^{-n-1}\, dz = 0, \quad (n = -1, -2, \dots).    
      \]
      Therefore,
      \begin{align}
        |a_n| &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \left|\int_{|z|=R} \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{n+1}} \, dz
          - \int_{|z|=R} \frac{p_m(z)}{(z-z_0)^{n+1}}\, dz\right|\nonumber \\[4pt]
        &\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{|z|=R} \frac{|f(z)-p_m(z)|}{|z-z_0|^{n+1}} \, |dz|.
        \label{eq:1991-5-1}
      \end{align}
      Finally, $p_m \rightarrow f$ uniformly on $|z| = R$, so~(\ref{eq:1991-5-1})
      implies $|a_n|=0$ for $n = -1, -2, \dots$. This proves that
      $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (z-z_0)^n$, converging locally uniformly in
      $|z|<2$. Whence $f\in H(|z|<2)$.

SOLUTION 7.
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}
      We must show that $\FT = \{f_n\}$ is a normal family.
      If we can prove that $\FT$ is a locally bounded family of holomorphic
      functions -- that is, $\FT \subset H(D)$ and, for any compact set $K\subset D$, there is an $M_K >0$
      such that $|f_n(z)| \leq M_K$ for all $z\in K$ and all $n=1,2,\dots$ -- then the
      \index{Montel's theorem!applied}
      Montel theorem (corollary~\ref{cor:montel}) will give the desired result.
      
      To show $\FT$ is locally bounded, it is equivalent to show that, for each point
      $z_\alpha \in D$, there is a number $M_\alpha$ and a neighborhood 
      $B(z_\alpha, r_\alpha)\subset D$ such that $|f_n(z)|\leq M_\alpha$ for all
      $z\in B(z_\alpha, r_\alpha)$ and all $n=1,2,\ldots$. (Why is this 
      equivalent?)\footnote{Answer: If
        $K\subset D$ is compact, we could select a finite covering of $K$ by such
        neighborhoods $B(z_{\alpha_j},r_{\alpha_j})\; (j=1, \dots, J)$ and then
        $|f_n(z)|\leq \max_j M_{\alpha_j} \triangleq M_K$, for all $z\in K$ and
        $n=1,2,\dots$.} So, fix $z_\alpha \in D$. Let $R_\alpha >0$ be such that 
      $\bar{B}(z_\alpha, R_\alpha) = \{z \in \C: |z-z_\alpha|\leq R_\alpha\}\subset D$.
      Then, for any $z\in B(z_\alpha, R_\alpha/2)$, Cauchy's formula gives
      \index{Cauchy's theorem!problems}
      \begin{align*}
        |f_n(z)| 
        &\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{|\zeta - z_\alpha|=R_\alpha}
        \frac{|f_n(\zeta)|}{|\zeta - z|} \, |d\zeta|\\[4pt]
        &\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{1}{R_\alpha/2} 
        \int_{|\zeta - z_\alpha|=R_\alpha} |f_n(\zeta)|\, |d\zeta|\\[4pt]
        &\leq \frac{M}{\pi R_\alpha}.
      \end{align*}
      The second inequality holds since $|\zeta - z_\alpha|=R_\alpha$ and
      $|z-z_\alpha|< R_\alpha/2$ imply $|\zeta - z| > R_\alpha/2$. The last inequality
      follows from the hypothesis $\int_C |f_n(z)|\,|dz| \leq M$ for any circle $C$ in
      $D$.  Letting $M_\alpha = \frac{M}{\pi R_\alpha}$, and 
      $r_\alpha = R_\alpha/2$, we have $|f_n(z)| \leq M_\alpha$ for all 
      $z\in B(z_\alpha, r_\alpha)$ and all $n=1,2,\dots$, as desired.
