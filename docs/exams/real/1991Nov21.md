1. 
    a.  Let $f_n$ be a sequence of continuous, real valued functions on $[0, 1]$ which
        converges uniformly to $f$.  Prove that $\lim_{n → ∞} f_n (x_n) = f(1/2)$ for
        every sequence $\{x_n\}$ that converges to $1/2$.  
    b.  Must the conclusion still hold if the convergence is only point-wise? Explain.

2.  Let $f : ℝ → ℝ$ be differentiable and assume there is no $x ∈ ℝ$ such that 
    $f(x) = f'(x) = 0$.  Show that $S = \{x : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, f(x) = 0\}$ is finite.

3.  If $(X, Σ, μ)$ is a measure space and if $f$ is $μ$-integrable, show that for
    every $ϵ > 0$ there exists $E ∈ Σ$ such that $μ(E) < ∞$ and $∫_{X - E} |f| \, dμ < ϵ$.

4.  If $(X, Σ, μ)$ is a measure space, $f$ is a non-negative measurable function, and
    $ν(E) = ∫_E f \, dμ$, show that $ν$ is a measure.

5.  Suppose $f$ is a bounded, real valued function on $[0, 1]$.  Show that $f$ is
    Lebesgue measurable if and only if $\sup ∫ ψ \, dm = \inf ∫ ϕ \, dm$, where
    $m$ is Lebesgue measure and $ϕ$ and $ψ$ range over all simple functions for 
    which $ψ ≤ f ≤ ϕ$.

6.  If $f$ is Lebesgue integrable on $[0, 1]$ and $ϵ > 0$, show that there exists 
    $δ > 0$ such that for all measurable sets $E ⊂ [0, 1]$ with $m(E) < \delta$, we
    have $| ∫_E f\, dm | < ϵ$.

7.  Suppose $f$ is a bounded, real valued, measurable function on $[0, 1]$ such that
    $∫ x^n f\, dm = 0$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, …$, where $m$ is Lebesgue measure.  Show that
    $f(x) = 0$ a.e.

8.  If $μ$ and $ν$ are finite measures on the measurable space $(X, Σ)$, show that
    there is a nonnegative measurable function $f$ on $X$ such that for all $E$ in
    $Σ$, $∫_E (1 - f)\, dμ = ∫_E f\, dν$. <!-- (cf. 1997 Nov Prob 7). -->

9.  If $f$ and $g$ are integrable functions on $(X, S, μ)$ and $(Y, T , ν)$,
    respectively, and $F(x, y) = f (x) g(y)$, show that $F$ is integrable on 
    $X × Y$ and $∫ F \, d(μ × ν) = ∫ f  \, dμ ∫ g\, dν$.
