Do as many problems as you can.  Complete solutions to five problems would be considered a good performance.

<!-- 
The inverse function theorem does not appear on the syllabus and, as far as I know, this is the only exam problem in which it has appeared. The implicit function theorem *does* appear on the syllabus, but I have never encountered an exam problem that required it.

1. a. State the inverse function theorem.\
   b. Suppose $L\colon \mathbb R^3 \rightarrow \mathbb R^3$ is an invertible linear map and that 
      $g\colon \mathbb R^3 \rightarrow \mathbb R^3$ has continuous first order partial derivatives and satisfies 
      $\|g(x)\| \leq C\|x\|^2$ for some constant $C$ and all $x\in \mathbb R^3$. Here $\|x\|$ denotes the usual Euclidean norm on $\mathbb R^3$.  Prove that $f(x) = L(x) + g(x)$ is locally invertible near $0$.

2. Let $f$ be a differentiable real valued function on the interval $(0,1)$, and suppose the derivative of $f$ is bounded on this interval.  Prove the existence of the limit $L = \lim_{x\rightarrow 0^+} f(x)$.

3. Let $f$ and $g$ be Lebesgue integrable functions on $[0,1]$, and let $F$ and $G$ be the integrals 
   $$F(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \ dt, \quad G(x) = \int_0^x g(t) \ dt.$$
   Use Fubini's and/or Tonelli's Theorem to prove that $$\int_0^1 F(x)g(x) \ dx = F(1) G(1) - \int_0^1 f(x)G(x) \ dx.$$ Other approaches to this problem are possible, but credit will be given only to solutions based on these theorems.

4. Let $(X, A, \mu)$ be a finite measure space and suppose $\nu$ is a finite measure on $(X, A)$ that is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$. Prove that the norm of the Radon-Nikodym derivative $f = \left[\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\right]$ is the same in $L^\infty (\mu)$ as it is in $L^\infty(\nu)$.

5. Suppose that $\\{f_n\\}$ is a sequence of Lebesgue measurable functions on $[0,1]$ such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int_0^1 |f_n|\ dx = 0$ and there is an integrable function $g$ on $[0,1]$ such that $|f_n|^2 \leq g$, for each $n$. Prove that $\lim_n \int_0^1 |f_n|^2\ dx =0$.

6. Denote by $\mathcal P_e$ the family of all even polynomials.  Thus a polynomial $p$ belongs to $\mathcal P_e$ if and only if $p(x) = \frac{p(x) + p(-x)}{2}$ for all $x$. Determine, with proof, the closure of $\mathcal P_e$ in $L^1[-1,1]$.  You may use without proof the fact that continuous functions on $[-1,1]$ are dense in $L^1[-1,1]$.

7. Suppose that $f$ is real valued and integrable with respect to Lebesgue measure $m$ on $\mathbb R$ and that there are real numbers $a<b$ such that $$a \cdot m(U) \leq \int_U f \ dm \leq b \cdot m(U),$$ for all open sets $U$ in $\mathbb R$.  Prove that $a \leq f(x) \leq b$ a.e.

SOLUTION 1.
  \ifthenelse{\boolean{includeSolutions}}{\begin{solution}~\\
      \index{inverse function theorem!of calculus|ii}
      {\bf (a)} (Inverse function theorem (IFT) of calculus)\footnote{See Rudin~\cite{Rudin:1976}.}\\
      Let $f:E\rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ be a $C^1$-mapping of an open set
      $E\subset \mathbb R^n$.  Suppose that $f'(a)$ is invertible for some $a\in E$ and
      that $f(a)=b$. Then,
      \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
      \item there exist open sets $U$ and $V$ in $\mathbb R^n$ such that $a\in U$, $b\in V$,
        and $f$ maps $U$ bijectively onto $V$, and
      \item if $g$ is the inverse of $f$ (which exists by (i)), defined on $V$ by
        $g(f(x))=x$, for $x\in U$, then $g\in C^1(V)$.\\[4pt]
      \end{enumerate}
      {\bf (b)} First note that $L$ and $g$ both have continuous first order partial
      derivatives; \ie $L, g \in C^1(\mathbb R^3)$.  Therefore, the derivative of $f = L + g$, 
      \[
      f'(x) \triangleq J_f(x) \triangleq \left(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}\right)_{i,j=1}^3
      \] 
      exists.  Furthermore, $J_f(x)$ is continuous in a neighborhood of the zero vector,
      because this is true of the partials of $g(x)$, and the partials of $L(x)$ are the
      constant matrix $L$.
      Therefore, $f \in C^1(\mathbb R^3)$.  
      By the IFT, then, we need only show that $f'(0)$ is invertible. Since
      $f'(x) = L + g'(x)$, we must show $f'(0) = L + g'(0)$ is invertible.  Consider the matrix $g'(0) =
      J_g(0)$.  We claim, $J_g(0)=0$. Indeed, if $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are the elementary
      unit vectors (also known as {\bf i, j, k}), then the elements of $J_g(0)$ are 
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:2000-1}
        \frac{\partial g_i}{\partial x_j}(0) 
        = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{g_i(0 + h x_j) - g_i(0)}{h}
        = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{g_i(h x_j)}{h}.
      \end{equation}
      The second equality follows by the hypothesis that $g$ is continuous and satisfies
      $\|g(x)\| \leq C\|x\|^2$, which implies that $g(0) =0$.  Finally, to show
      that~(\ref{eq:2000-1}) is zero, consider
      \[
      |g_i(h x_j)| \leq \|g(h x_j)\| \leq C \|h x_j\|^2 = C|h|^2,
      \]
      which implies
      \[
      \frac{|g_i(h x_j)|}{|h|} \leq C \frac{|h x_j|^2}{|h|} = C|h| \rightarrow 0, \text{
        as $h\rightarrow 0$.}
      \]
      This proves that $f'(0) = L$, which is invertible by assumption, so the IFT
      implies that $f(x)$ is locally invertible near 0. 
      \qed
