This includes the blockchain layer determining what is a valid block, but does not include any concurrency issues such as chain selection. The details of the background and the larger context for the design decisions formalized in this document are presented in Appendix Section\u00a0shelley-delegation-design.</p> <p>In this document, we present the most important properties that any implementation of the ledger must have. Specifically, we model the following aspects of the functionality of the ledger on the blockchain:</p> <p>In defining Cardano, we are concerned with the means to construct inductive datatypes satisfying some validity conditions. For example, we wish to consider when a sequence of transactions forms a valid ledger, or a sequence of blocks forms a valid chain.</p> <p>This document describes the methods we use to define such validity conditions and how they result in the construction of valid states. In particular, we define inference rules for operations on a blockchain as a specification of the blockchain layer of Cardano. A block validity definition is given, which is accompanied by small-step operational semantics inference rules.</p> <p>The idea behind this document is to formalise what it means for a new block, to be added to the blockchain, to be valid. Unless a new block is valid, it cannot be added to the blockchain and thereby extend it. This is needed for a system that is subscribed to the blockchain and keeps a copy of it locally.</p> <p>Each block is made up of transactions and this specification models the conditions that the different parts of a transaction must fulfill so that they can extend a ledger, which is represented here as a list of transactions. In particular, we model the following aspects:</p> <p>Preservation of value</p> <p>:   relationship between the total value of input and outputs in a new     transaction, and the unspent outputs.</p> <p>Witnesses</p> <p>:   authentication of parts of the transaction data by means of     cryptographic entities (such as signatures and private keys)     contained in these transactions.</p> <p>Delegation</p> <p>:   validity of delegation certificates, which delegate block-signing     rights.</p> <p>Update validation</p> <p>:   voting mechanism which captures the identification of the voters,     and the participants that can post update proposals.</p> <p>Stake</p> <p>:   staking rights associated to an addresses.</p> <pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Preservation of value</p> <p>:   Every coin in the system must be accounted for, and the total amount     is unchanged by every transaction and epoch change. In particular,     every coin is accounted for by exactly one of the following     categories:</p> <pre><code>-   Circulation (UTxO)\n\n-   Deposit pot\n\n-   Fee pot\n\n-   Reserves (monetary expansion)\n\n-   Rewards (account addresses)\n\n-   Treasury\n</code></pre> <p>Witnesses</p> <p>:   Authentication of parts of the transaction data by means of     cryptographic entities (such as signatures and private keys)     contained in these transactions.</p> <p>Delegation</p> <p>:   Validity of delegation certificates, which delegate block-signing     rights.</p> <p>Stake</p> <p>:   Staking rights associated to an address.</p> <p>Rewards</p> <p>:   Reward calculation and distribution.</p> <p>Updates</p> <p>:   The update mechanism for Shelley protocol parameters and software.</p> <p>While the blockchain protocol is a reactive system that is driven by the arrival of blocks causing updates to the ledger, the formal description is a collection of rules that compose a static description of what a valid ledger is. A valid ledger state can only be reached by applying a sequence of inference rules and any valid ledger state is reachable by applying some sequence of these rules. The specifics of the semantics we use to define and apply the rules we present in this document are explained in detail in [@small-step-semantics] (this document will really help the reader's understanding of the contents of this specification).</p> <p>The structure of the rules that we give here is such that their application is deterministic. That is, given a specific initial state and relevant environmental constants, there is no ambiguity about which rule should be applied at any given time (i.e.\u00a0which state transition is allowed to take place). This property ensures that the specification is totally precise --- no choice is left to the implementor and any two implementations must behave the same when it comes to deciding whether a block is valid.</p>"},{"location":"cardano-ledger/license/","title":"License","text":"<pre><code>                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n</code></pre> <p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION</p> <ol> <li> <p>Definitions.</p> <p>\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.</p> <p>\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by   the copyright owner that is granting the License.</p> <p>\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common   control with that entity.

If $H$ is a $p$-group and $H &lt; G$, then $H$ is called a $p$-subgroup.  A maximal $p$-subgroup of $G$---that is, a $p$-subgroup of $G$ contained in no larger $p$-subgroup---is called a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$      First Sylow theorem. Let $G$ be a group of order $p^n m$, with $p$ prime, $n\\geq 1$ and $(p,m) = 1$. Then for each $1\\leq k &lt; n$, $G$ contains a subgroup of order $p^k$ and every subgroup of $G$ of order $p^k$ ($k &lt; n$) is normal in some subgroup of order $p^{k+1}$.     Second sylow theorem. If $H$ is a $p$-subgroup of a finite group $G$, and if $P$ is any Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, then there exists $x\\in G$ such that $H\\leq xPx^{-1}. In particular, any two Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ are conjugate.     Third Sylow theorem. If $G$ is a finite group and $p$ a prime, then the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ divides $|G|$ and is of the form $kp +1$ for some $k \\geq 0$.     </p> 1.b. <p> The number of Sylow $7$-subgroups must be congruent to $1$ modulo $7$ and divide $140$, hence must be $1$. Call this subgroup $H$. $H$ is then normal in $G$, by the Second Sylow Theorem. Similary, the number of Sylow $5$-subgroups must be congruent to $1$ modulo $5$ and divide $140$, hence must be $1$. Call this (normal) subgroup $K$. The nonidentity elements of $H$ all have order $7$ and the nonidentity elements of $K$ all have order $5$. As $H$ and $K$ are normal in $G$, $HK$ is a subgroup and as $H\\cap K = (e)$, $|HK| = 35$. Thus, by Lagrange's Theorem, $HK$ is a subgroup of index $|G:HK| = |G|/|HK| = 4$. If $g \\in G$, then $gHKg^{-1}= gHg^{-1}gKg^{-1}\\subseteq HK$, since $H$ and $K$ are both normal in $G$.  Thus, $HK$ is also normal in $G$.   Every commutator $[a, b]$, where either $a$ or $b$ is in $HK$, is equal to the identity.  As $|HK| = 35$, the commutator subgroup $G'$ is of order $1$, $2$, or $4$. Therefore the commutator subgroup is abelian as all groups of such orders are abelian. </p> 2. <p> Let $hk \\in HK$. We show $(hk)^{-1} = k^{-1}h^{-1} \\in HK$. Since $K$ is normal, $hk^{-1}h^{-1} =k'\\in K$. Therefore, $k^{-1}h^{-1}= h^{-1}k' \\in HK$. </p> <p> Let $hk \\in HK$, and $h_1k_1 \\in HK$. We show $hkh_1k_1\\in HK$.  Since $K$ is normal in $G$, there exist $k_2$ and $k_3$ such that $hkh_1k_1= hkh_1k_1h_1^{-1}h_1= h kk_2h_1 = h h_1h_1^{-1}kk_2h_1 = hh_1k_3$, which is clearly in $HK$. Therefore, $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$.  $K$ is normal in $G$ so $N_G(K) = G$. $H \\subseteq N_G(H)$ by definition. So $H\\cap K \\in N_G(H),$ i.e., $H\\cap K$ is normal in $H$. Since $K$ is normal in $G$, the quotient group $HK/K$ is well-defined. Define a map $\\phi \\colon H \\to HK/K$ by $\\phi(h) = hK$. Then $\\phi$ is a homomorphism since for all $h_1, h_2\\in H$, we have $\\phi(h_1h_2) = h_1K h_2K = h_1 h_2 K$ because as $K\\triangleleft G$. The kernel of $\\phi$ consists of all elements $h\\in H$ such that $hK =K$; that is, $\\ker h =  H\\cap K$. For any element $hk \\in HK$, $\\phi(hk) = hK$ so $\\phi$ is surjective. Therefore, by the first isomorphism theorem for groups, and $H/H\\cap K \\cong HK/K$.  </p> 3.a. <p> Theorem. (Class Equation) Suppose $G$ is a group.

Let \\(\\varphi_1: A\\times B \\rightarrow {\\ensuremath{A\\otimes_R}}(B\\oplus C)\\) be given by \\(\\varphi_1(a,b)=a\\otimes (b,0),\\) and let \\(\\varphi_2: A\\times C \\rightarrow {\\ensuremath{A\\otimes_R}}(B\\oplus C)\\) be given by \\(\\varphi_2(a,c)=a\\otimes (0,c)\\). It is easily verified that \\(\\varphi_i\\) are bilinear and thus induce \\(R\\)-module homomorphisms \\(\\bar{\\varphi_1}: {\\ensuremath{A\\otimes_R}}B \\rightarrow {\\ensuremath{A\\otimes_R}}(B\\oplus C)\\) and \\(\\bar{\\varphi_2}: {\\ensuremath{A\\otimes_R}}C \\rightarrow {\\ensuremath{A\\otimes_R}}(B\\oplus C)\\) such that \\(\\bar{\\varphi_i} \\kappa_i = \\varphi_i,\\) where \\(\\kappa_1: A\\times B \\rightarrow {\\ensuremath{A\\otimes_R}}B\\) and \\(\\kappa_2: A\\times C \\rightarrow {\\ensuremath{A\\otimes_R}}C\\) are the canonical bilinear maps.

Again, \\(\\psi\\) is bilinear, so there is a unique \\(\\Psi: {\\ensuremath{A\\otimes_R}}(B\\oplus C) \\rightarrow (B\\oplus C) \\rightarrow ({\\ensuremath{A\\otimes_R}}B) \\oplus ({\\ensuremath{A\\otimes_R}}C)\\) such that \\(\\Psi \\kappa = \\psi\\) where \\(\\kappa: A\\times (B\\oplus C) \\rightarrow {\\ensuremath{A\\otimes_R}}(B\\oplus C)\\) is canonical.
